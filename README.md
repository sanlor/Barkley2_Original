# Barkley2_Original
 The original source code for Barkley2, developed by Tales of Games.

 The code was originally published here (in Zip format): https://talesofgames.itch.io/barkley-2/devlog/262720/the-future-of-barkley-2 under under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

 This repository is mostly to assist me in my personal project to port this game to Godot (makes it easier to read code and make notes).

 This game was made in GameMaker Studio 1.4 (I use GMS 1.4.9999). Unfortunately, the owner company basically disowned this version and its not possible to get a legal copy of the software anymore (I have a license that I cant use, actually). Sail the seas to get one.

The DevÂ´s website went offline this year (2024), here is the last snapshot avaiable: https://web.archive.org/web/20240426141258/http://www.talesofgames.com/

The source file is mostly untouched, except for the .gitignore file (I modified it to allow .exe files and other binaries).
