How the new gun optimizer works:

All guns are broken up into sheets of guns (9 sheets of 9 gun materials with 26 types per material). When the game starts up, no gun sheets are loaded up.

When the game tries to draw a gun sprite, it runs through scr_hud_gun_draw or scr_hud_gun_draw_ext. This script then fetches the right sheet, that sheet is loaded into memory, and the sprite is drawn.

How to generate new gun sheets:

1. Open up FrankieGunOptimizer.

2. Replace the Included File with your latest GUNSGUNSGUNS file, but make sure it's a PNG.

3. Run the game, once it loads the files have been generated.

4. Go to AppData and get the files generated.

5. Replace the current gun sheets in Barkley 2 with the new ones you just made.
