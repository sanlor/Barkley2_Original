// Warehouse door temporarily inaccessible.
// At the point, the player regains control and can optionally go and talk to Slag at the bottom of the screen. They will there have the option to revert to Slag's resolution of the quest. This will delete this script from the map and replace it with the image of Lugner's dead body. This is a bit of an optional thing I thought up while talking to Frankie, so it can be dropped if it's deemed unnecessary. We can just have the player refuse to leave until they press the button.

// State 1(in the lull before the button press

    scr_event_build_dialogue("Lugner", s_port_lugner01, "Aren't you going to press the button?");

// The warehouse door is accessible again.
// The music cuts out entirely for now, resumes after the player has left the warehouse.
// Some sort of sound plays to draw the player's attention to the shipping container, and a moment later the piston crushes the crate entirely, killing all of the dwarfs. A long pause.

The more of these wastes of space I can kill the closer I am to getting off this rock, finding something else to smash for a change.\Fucking Kobolds are just too goddamn squishy to smash effectively.
