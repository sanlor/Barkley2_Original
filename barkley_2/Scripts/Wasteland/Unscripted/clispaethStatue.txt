I don't want to bother Clispaeth right now. I'm sure he's got enough on his plate...

X114JAM9:
Hey, it's a Clispaeth statue... I wonder if he can hear me...

There's something I want to talk to you about, Clispaeth...

	X114JAM9:
	Hey Clispaeth. I know it's been a while and I'm not sure if you're listening, but... well, here goes. There's a lot going on right now and I've got a lot on my chest. You don't have to listen if you don't want. I mean, I know you're busy and everything, but I guess I just wanted to talk about...
	
	//if mainQuest = 0
	...who I am.
	
		X114JAM9:
		...who I am. I... I don't remember who I am, Clispaeth. I don't know who I used to be or where I came from or what any of this Cuchulainn and Cyberdwarf stuff I've been thrown into has to do with me. All I know is that the Cyberdwarf knows something and that I've got to find him... Clispaeth, did I used to be a bad person? Whatever I did to get tangled up in all this stuff... was I one of the bad guys? I guess that's the thing I'm most scared of, knowing who I used to be... because... because if I was one of the bad guys, maybe I do deserve this. That's all.
		
		//go to After Prayer.
	
	...going home.
	
		X114JAM9:
		...going home. I woke up without my memory in the generator room of the dwarf space ziggurat Necron 7 and have been pushed around by people I don't know ever since. I don't know where I am or where I'm going or what's happening or why I'm being forced to do this crazy stuff. I don't know who Cuchulainn is or who the dwarfs are or who Cyberdwarf is... I... I just wanna go home. But I don't even know where that is. I... probably sound like I'm whining right now, don't I, Clispaeth? I'm sorry. That's not how I mean to sound. I can take care of myself and I'm learning that I can take care of other people too. But... but I'm still just a kid. I want to shoot hoops with my friends and play vidcons and eat candy. This Cyberdwarf stuff... I get it, it's my responsibility now. There are questions that need to be answered and things that need to be done. But... but I wish I wasn't the one who had to do them. I just want to go home...
		
		//go to After Prayer.
	
	...Cuchulainn.
	
		X114JAM9:
		...Cuchulainn. Now this guy's a real piece of work. I spent some time in Tir na Nog, this ghetto where Cuchulainn's been rounding up dwarfs and let me tell you, he really gets my goat. And get this: apparently he was keeping me in some sort of stasis and using my body as a generator for the Necron 7. I mean, what the cluck? He could have at least thrown me a permission waiver or something. And here's the weird thing - nobody's actually seen or knows who this guy is. This may just be a hunch, but I think something weird's going on. I'm going to gumshoe my way to bottom of this one way or another...
		
		//go to After Prayer.
	
	...responsibility.
	
		X114JAM9:
		...responsibility. With Cuchulainn and the Cyberdwarf and the dwarfs and everything... Being thrust into all this crazy stuff that I don't know the first thing about. Why does it have to be me? Why do I have to do this Cyberdwarf stuff, help all those dwarfs? But... I guess looking out for people who can't look out for themselves is part of being a good person. It's... it's pretty tough to be the good guy sometimes, and I wish it didn't have to be me. I want to go home. I just... I don't want any of this. I'm a kid. I want to shoot hoops with my friends and go to school and play vidcons and eat candy. But I guess it's part of growing up, being responsible. I didn't want this, but sometimes you've gotta live with what you've been given, make grapeade out of grapes. That's what dad always used to say.
		
		X114JAM9:
		...dad?
		
		X114JAM9:
		I... miss dad...

	...b-ball.
	
		X114JAM9:
		...b-ball. People don't really seem to care much about b-ball around here, do they? It kind of stinks... I mean, I love b-ball. I wish I had someone to talk to about it. Like layups and dunks and stuff. I guess I just feel kind of alone... nobody to talk to about my interests or anything... it really stinks. I wish I had someone to hang out with or play a quick round, maybe some horse or something. I dunno. Well, I don't want to take up your time. I'm sure you've got way more important stuff to hear about than freethrows.
		
		//hoopzBball ++
		//go to After Prayer.

I'd really like...

	X114JAM9:
	I know it's been a while, Clispaeth, and I'm sorry. I try to be a good Klispin but sometimes it's hard, especially with the way things have been. I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can, there's something I'd like to ask of you. This might sound kind of selfish, and I'm sorry, but I need you right now Clispaeth. I'd like...
	
	...power.
	
		X114JAM9:
		...power, so I can destroy Cuchulainn once and for all. But I don't just need any power, I need the power of...
		
		//hoopzPower ++
	
		...gun's.
		
			X114JAM9:
			...gun's. I need huge gun's, fast gun's, shotgun's, machine gun's, bazooka gun's, ooze gun's, zauber gun's, cyber gun's... a veritable bento of gun's. I need to get better with gun's in every conceivable way and more importantly, I need to get better at fusing them. I want to create the greatest, most powerful gun's of all time; I want to be the greatest gun'smith to have ever lived. That's what I want. Amen.
			
			//gunsVar ++
			//go to After Prayer.
		
		...zaubers.
		
			X114JAM9:
			...zaubers. I want to be the most powerful zaubermancer in the galaxy, more powerful than the great octoroon Balthios of the James dynasty. I want the power of the zaubers to destroy Cuchulainn and free the dwarfs of Necron 7. But I also want to explore their ancient and cosmic wisdom, study their forgotten insights and ponder the forbidden philosophies of the zaubermancers of old. I want the power of the zaubers because of their potential to reshape reality to my desires. That's what I want. Amen.
			
			//hoopzZauber ++
			//go to After Prayer.
		
		...technology.
		
			X114JAM9:
			...technology. There are answers I need and people I need to protect but I can't do it the way I am now. I want to upgrade my body to do things nobody else can do. I want to run faster, see farther, ball harder than anyone who's ever lived. I want to be something more than I am, something... post-human. Clispaeth, I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can, I want you to give me the power of technology so I can face the dangers ahead and help the dwarfs... amen.
			
			//transhumanismVar ++
			//go to After Prayer.
		
		...the Verboten Jams.
			
			X114JAM9:
			Cuchulainn, the Cyberdwarf, the Duergars, L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S... what does it even matter? What does it matter in the face of a power so extraordinary that it can reshape the universe, that it can birth and destroy with a single jam? The power I seek is greater than any ever known, the power to defy any man or god, the power to create from the infinitely intangible. If you can hear me, Clispaeth, what I need is the power of the Verboten Ja-
			
			X114JAM9:
			...huh? What did I just say?
			
			X114JAM9:
			...
			
			X114JAM9:
			...the Chaos Dunk.

	...candy.
	
		X114JAM9:
		...candy. I want candy, every kind in the world. I don't care about anything else, I just wanna get lots of candy. Malt balls, chocolate dubloons, butterscotch, salt water taffy... heck, even candy corn! I just want candy. I wanna eat it all and I don't care who knows because dad's not here to stop me. Clispaeth, if you can hear me... I need a bento of candy. Amen.

		//go to After Prayer.
	
	...to go home.
	
		X114JAM9:
		...to go home. The dwarfs here are nice, I guess... some of them. But... but this isn't home. I don't really know where home is, but I feel this sense of loss and longing for something else. Something that belongs to me. Something totally my own. A place where I'm safe, where I don't have to be afraid of Cuchulainn or Duergars or any of this other stupid crap, where my only responsibility is being a kid. A place where I can be myself and I don't have to be scared. That's all I want. Amen.
		
		//go to After Prayer.
	
	//if mainQuest = > 0
	...for everything to go back to normal.
	
		X114JAM9:
		...for everything to go back to normal. I don't want to be here, I didn't want to be X1, I don't want to fight Cuchulainn or find the Cyberspear... I just want everything to go back to normal. I want to be home with my dad. I want to play vidcons and shoot hoops and go to school and be with my friends. I mean... this is all just so... so... stupid. It's stupid. I just wish... I wish none of this ever happened. I wish I was just a normal kid again. I just want to be me. That's all. Amen.
		
		//go to After Prayer.
	
	//if mainQuest = 0
	...to know who I am.
	
		X114JAM9:
		...to know who I really am. I don't know anything about the Cyberdwarf or Cuchulainn or Duergars any of that stuff. I don't know why I have to find the Cyberdwarf or why I'm here or what's going on. I just... I just want to know who I am, why this is happening to me. I'm just a kid. I want to go home and have friends and be with my family, even if I don't know who that is. I just... I don't know Clispaeth. I just want to be me... I just want to be me. Amen.
		
		//go to After Prayer.
	
	...to get really good at b-ball.
	
		X114JAM9:
		...to get really good at b-ball. I want to be the best b-ball player ever, better than Chocolate Thunder, King James, Air Jordan or even the Round Mound of Rebound himself. I want to be able to juke out my foes, both on the court... and off. And most importantly, I want the power of... the Verboten Jams. Doubleteam, the Showboat Jam, the Juke Warp and... and even the Chaos Dunk. That's all I want. To be a great baller just like all my heroes were. Amen.

Kiss my grits, Clispaeth!

	X114JAM9:
	Hey Clispaeth: kiss my grits! You're a crock of crud and a crock of bull puck! Get a life... capice? See ya... wouldn't wanna be ya.

No, maybe later.

Wow. I guess I forgot how hard it is being honest with yourself. Maybe I should try being open more often. Whether or not you were listening, Clispaeth, I think this was a good thing...
