Moriarty:
Meat... meat on the bone... meat on the bone...

X114JAM9:
Um, are you uh... Morrison?

Moriarty:
Moriarty... Flesh... you have... tender... delicious... flesh...

X114JAM9:
It's one of the symptoms of being alive, I guess. I've got a couple questions for you about the missing junk prospector Figbottom. Think you've got the time?

Moriarty:
Figbottom... I know that guy... I saw him digging around in the trash with his buddy a couple days ago... His friend looked too gristly but Figbottom... Figbottom looked perfect... they found this thing in the trash, a jerkin... they fought over the jerkin but in the end Figbottom took it... but today his friend is wearing it...

X114JAM9:
What the shuck... Suresh didn't mention that to me. I've got one more question for you, Moriarty. Are you uh... eating a glove?

Moriarty:
Meat on the bone... gotta get that... meat on the bone...

X114JAM9:
I sincerely hope that's just a glove you picked up off the ground and not Figbottom's. I'll be back if I've got anymore questions.

Moriarty:
Meat....... on the bone...

Moriarty:
Soft, pliant flesh, still warm, the cruor still wet... chewy tendons and sinews, brittle bones snapping under compaction, giving way to succulent marrow... meat on the bone... meat on the bone...
