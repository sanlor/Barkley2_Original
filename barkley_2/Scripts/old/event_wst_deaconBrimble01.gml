X114JAM9:
Hey dude... keep it down... check this out. Premium quality chups.

Deacon Brimble:
Oooooh shit. Is this that Tijuana gold? Holy Clispaeth, it is. I could tell you were carrying from like 100 feet away, that shit's danker than a dog sack. Look at that sticky shit. It's like the Summer of '33 up in here. Hell yeah dude, lemme at it. 

X114JAM9:
Not so fast, buddy. That's gonna cost you.

Deacon Brimble:
Chill, chill bro. Chill. I've played the game before, I know how it works. I got you covered. Check out this 25 note.

I'll take it.

X114JAM9:
You just got a really good deal... take it.

Deacon Brimble:
GatDAM. It's been like 2 weeks since my last hook up. Hope Sister Irmingard doesn't make me pee in a cup anytime soon. You rule dude, hit me up again sometime.

Get 25 neo-shekels!

//get 25 neoshekels
//chupCount --
//deaconBrimbleChup = 1
//neoShekelCount +=25
//end dialogue;

Are you serious?

X114JAM9:
Are you kidding me? 25 for primo quality chups? This isn't Woodstock, buddy.

Deacon Brimble:
Look dude, this deacon gig isn't bringing in the big bucks, you know? Gimme some time and I'll pay you back big time... like... 500 neo-shekels. Just gimme a little while.

X114JAM9:
25 neo-shekels now and 500 when I come back in a little while?

Deacon Brimble:
Yeah dude, that's the score. C'mon, I'm dying, you gotta gimme a taste. Ask Sister Irmingard, she'll tell you I'll pay you back. Just uh, don't mention the chups.

Okay, but I'll be back.

X114JAM9:
Okay, take 'em. But don't you dare bail on me. I'll be back and I'll want that money.

Deacon Brimble:
Awwww, that's what I wanted to hear! I knew you were chill as hell. Clispaeth mofuggin' Christ, HOOOOOEEEEEY! Smell these bad boys! I ain't peein' in a cup for months. Yeah dude, come back in a little while and I'll cover this, I promise. Just gimme some time.

X114JAM9:
I'll be back.

//get 25 neoshekels

//end dialogue;

I don't trust you. No way.

X114JAM9:
Forget it. I'm not falling for it. No deal.

Deacon Brimble:
Awww, man. You're lame as hell. Can't even hook a brother up, huh?

X114JAM9:
Whatever, man. I'm outta here. Chump...

Deacon Brimble:
Look dude, if you wanna convert the Cybergremlins, you gotta speak their language, y'know? Do they REALLY want some old ass rosary, or do they want a smelly ass, chewed up tennis shoe? I'll let you be the judge of that.

//end dialogue;

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// *** conversionQuest = 3 or 5 - Elder Zenobia wants artifact. ***
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

X114JAM9:
The Cybergremlins say they're only willing to convert if I can give them an artifact that belonged to Clispaeth... how am I supposed to find one of Clispaeth's relics? How do I even know what Clispaeth's relics are?

Deacon Brimble:
Heh... you ever think of maybe just... making one up?

X114JAM9:
Wh-what?

Deacon Brimble:
It's not like they're gonna know the difference. There's crap all over the place, just give 'em a piece of trash or something. It'll fit right in and they'll love it.

X114JAM9:
Are you even a priest?

Deacon Brimble:
Look dude, I didn't know what deacon meant when I signed up for the job. I thought it was the guy who trains pigs to search for truffles.

X114JAM9:
Well... as morally dubious as it sounds...

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// *** conversionQuest = 2 or 4 - Conversion Quest has been accepted. ***
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deacon Brimble:
Ayo! Don't take this the wrong way but I was listening to your conversation with Sister Irmingard. You're goin' to that Cybergremlin village? I mean, maybe this is your thing or whatever, and I'm not judging because we've all got things, heh, but that's sort of like diving head first into a septic tank. Look dude, I've been there, those guys are fuckin' idiots.

X114JAM9:
Aren't you a priest? That seems like a pretty terrible thing to say, how can you say that?

Deacon Brimble:
You can't teach an old dog new tricks and you can't teach a fuckin' idiot dog new tricks either. Just sayin'. Peace, hombre.

//end dialogue;

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// *** conversionQuest = 1 - Conversion Quest has been rejected. ***
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deacon Brimble:
'ey, what's the haps? Hope you don't mind but I overheard your conversation with Sister Irmingard about the Cybergremlin village? Don't do it dude, those guys are nasty. Like trash-eating, not bathing kind of nasty. I mean, I've been there, I've been there, but it's not like... my THING, you know? Anyway, I just wanted to say Sister Irmingard's a persistent lady and she'll probably ask you to do it again. Take my advice: don't do it. GatDAM don't do it. That's all.

//end dialogue;

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// *** no conditions ***
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deacon Brimble:
Dear Clispaeth: hey. Uh, I ask for the uh, holy libations of your greatness and sacraments of your grace... in these times of... grace. And that Sister Irmingard doesn't send me back to the Cybergremlin village. Thanks in advance. Keep it real.
