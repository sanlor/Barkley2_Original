Reincarnating Guy

A guy approaches you, inspects you and asks you if you're "her". You tell him you don't know who she is and he sighs and looks sad. You ask him what's wrong and he explains
that in a past life, he was the Savior of All Existence twice. The first time was when he and a woman he loved defeated a great evil together. The second time was when he
was forced to sacrifice the woman to save existence again. It has been countless years since this happened and he and she have lived, died and reincarnated perhaps billions
of times. It has been so long that he doesn't even remember what she looked like or who she was, as well as who he was. He has spent every reincarnation looking for her
and couldn't find her. He explains that he traded his soul for information that said she was on the Necron 7, and that because he no longer has a soul he will no longer
reincarnate, so he has to find her now.

You can ask him more questions about it, but he ultimately says that you can't help him find her because he doesn't know who she is, that she's just the imprint of a
feeling on his soul and that only he can find her.

If you've talked to him, he shows up at the end of the game right before you fight Cuchulainn and apologizes to you. "I don't think we will meet again."
