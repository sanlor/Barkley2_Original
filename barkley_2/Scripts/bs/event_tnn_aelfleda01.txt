Dwarfs don't usually last too long around here anyway, let alone come back from the mines. But here they were, living large and blowing a lot of shekels. I didn't even know where they got them./ What I dope I was! I was hanging out with Augustine a few nights ago, and maybe we had a bit too much juice... it's possible. He told me he forgot his billfold, and asked if I would cover the check, that he would pay me back first thing the next day. I said sure, and put it on my tab.

This would have been fine. But since I haven't been able to bring that money to the bank, I'll overdraft. Overdraft protection kicks in and tries to cover the overdraft penalty with funds from my savings account. They don't let you turn this off. And it was still fine. My utility payment is automatically deducted from my savings account, so I went down there the other morning with some of my rent money to cover that.
