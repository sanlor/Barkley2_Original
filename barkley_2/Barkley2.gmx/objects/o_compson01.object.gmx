PRISONINFO
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Hey Compson, I was talking to Lafayette about the mission to try starting a `sq`Hoosegow break to get all the rebels out.`rt`
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | And let me guess,- you think this is a great idea?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Well... could be...
WAIT   | 0.5
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | The Hoosegow is impossible to break out from. We've been looking at it for months now. It's a pipe dream. 
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | You've got enough brain cells rattling around up there to know what a pipe dream is don't you?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Come on, Mr. Compson. You're demoralizing the troops!
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | I'm just keeping it real. Someone has to.
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Oh, and while you're out there wasting your time, keep an eye out for soft dirt.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Soft dirt?
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Yes. We need some new plots for graves. If you find any good spots, let us know.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSad | ...
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Ok._ I'll keep my eyes peeled...
QUEST  | compsonState = 4

OUTPOSTREACTION
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | I'm out fifty neuro-shekels thanks to you. 
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Huh?
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Bet Meinhardt that you'd end up on the menu after that stunt you were pulling at the `kw`Duergar Outpost.`rt` 
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Got a double-or-nothing bet that we'll still live to see a Duergar marching around with a pair of P_NAME-skin boots. Until you wise your ass up, I'm expecting my luck is ready to change.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Uh, thanks for the vote of confidence...
QUEST  | compsonState = 3

OUTPOST_
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I saw that `sq`camp of Duergars nearby.`rt` They look kinda suspic-
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | While you are out there, keep an eye out for soft dirt.
WAIT   | 0.75
DIALOG | P_NAME       | What for?
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Graves. We're running short of plots. This mountain's too dry, and the ground is filled with rocks. 
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Personally I'm holding out for a nice moist spot deeper in the `kw`Fary Forest.`rt` That's where the worms are. And more worms means I'll be gobbled up nice and quick-like. Then there will be no trace.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzShock | ._._._
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Ok._ I'll keep my eyes peeled...

OUTPOSTDOUBT
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Hey, Lafayette suggested I ask you about some stuff.
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | What stuff?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Lafayette says that there's a `sq`camp of Duergars`rt` nearby. 
DIALOG | P_NAME       | He said they look kinda suspicious and keep you rebels from completing your missions. Do you know anything about them?
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | No.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Oh. Lafayette didn't tell you?
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | He might have, I've stopped listening.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Oh._._. Uh, the `kw`Duergars in the Outpost.`rt` Do you think they're dangerous?
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Probably. You ever met a Duergar that wasn't dangerous?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I don't think so. Shouldn't we do something about it?
WAIT   | 0.5
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Hmmm... I got one thing you can do.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | Yeah? Any info will help, sir!
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | We got some sheet you need to fill out, it's..._ for Clispaeth's sake, `s1`FLORIAN!`s0`

DIALOG | Lt. Florian  | S-_sir!
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Where the hell did those `kw`next-of-kin sheets`rt` go?
DIALOG | Lt. Florian  | The what, sir?
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | The sheets, you know. The one where the suckers put what we should do with their belongings, where we should bury 'em if their corpse turns up.
DIALOG | Lt. Florian  | Oh sir yes sir... 
DIALOG | Lt. Florian  | Well you see sir, it all started when Lafayette was scout-
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Come on, damnit, the `s1`SHORT VERSION.`s0` Always give me the `s1`SHORT VERSION.`s0`
DIALOG | Lt. Florian  | I had Lafayette fill out the last one when he stepped on that landmine.
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | No more sheets? Clispaeth-christ, we can't even fight this war bureaucratically. We're probably out of fuckin' pencils too.

DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | It doesn't matter much anyway, I doubt anyone will find what's left of you once you go poking around in the Duergar's nest.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | But someone's gotta do something!
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Ugh..._ look here, take this `kw`map.`rt`
USEAT  | o_compson01 
NOTIFY | Attained Gilbert's Peak Grave Sites Map!
Map    | gain | Gilbert Grave Sites
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | It'll show you just how impossible it is to do anything about the Outpost. If you want to try your hand at it, then go for it. You will fail.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzAngry | ...
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Don't give me that face, I'm not the one sending you out there. You're just as welcome to pick a hole to rot in here like the rest of us.
QUEST  | compsonState = 2

COMPSON04
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | I wonder if the Hoosegow courtyard has some good, soft soil for a grave.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | ...

COMPSON03
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Nothing to eat but rats, running short on toilet paper, not that we even have a working toilet, and now I'm also out of money. What a time to be alive.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | ...

COMPSON02
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Now what? Can't a dwarf be crestfallen in peace around here?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | ...

COMPSON01
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | Hey, you smell that?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Uh, no?
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | That's the smell of me not giving a shit.

COMPSON00
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | And here I thought I made it pretty clear that they're just wasting their time sending new recruits out here.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I'm sorry?
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | We're out of bunks, so just pick one of those cavern nooks over there and enjoy the last few naps of your measly life. That's if you even give enough of a damn to get comfortable. 
DIALOG | P_NAME       | ...?
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | I wouldn't bother, personally. Look at these poor bastards, they're the ones that got off easy. We ship out the ones that lose a couple limbs, and put down the ones that lose a few limbs too many.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Oh, I not really a rebel, I'm just a wayward stranger passing through.
DIALOG | Cpt. Compson | What's the difference? Get lost or hang around. Just doesn't make any difference.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzAngry | (Sheesh...)
