DIALOG | Guildenstern | Yeah, actually. You smell of something fucking awful. Better run for your damn life before I lose my fucking lunch.
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | Here, jerk, take a look at this `sq`letter`rt` that this fucking clown was not supposed to open.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Okay? Why do you want me to take this?
DIALOG | Guildenstern | Just read the fucking thing, you stupid helpful asshole.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | All right....
DIALOG | P_NAME       | `kw`/'Bound to this letter are but two duergars most gentle, noble Guildenstern and courageous Rosencrantz...../'`rt`

DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | Shut your fucking face and keep reading.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | `kw`/'Upon the neck of the most courageous Guildenstern is to be placed the axe of your most skilled headsman, and likewise the corpse of noble Rosencrantz is to be the featured subject of your finest gallows..../'`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Uh....this.....
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Yeah, this letter kinda took a turn at the end there.
DIALOG | Guildenstern | Yeah, no shit. And that asshole actually had us delivering this letter until Dr. Dumbass here opened it.
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | So what would you do if you got stuck with this letter?

DIALOG | Guildenstern | No, your deaf aunt Tilly. Yeah, fucking you.

LETTER_TERMINATE
DIALOG | P_NAME       | You could just throw the letter in the swamp? If the letter doesn't exist then nobody is going to try killing you when you get there.
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | He kinda has a point there. If this is the death warrant we could just throw the warrant away.
DIALOG | Guildenstern | No!! You fucking idiot, no!!!
DIALOG | Guildenstern | They're expecting a fucking letter, and without a letter we're just two dumbfucks standing around scratching our asses.
DIALOG | Guildenstern | They'd probably chop off our fucking hands just for losing the fucking letter in the fucking swamp.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Oh, well, in that case maybe you should...
GOTO   | WHAT_DO

LETTER_REWRITE
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Why don't you just make a new letter?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Just write something like `kw`/'Rosencrantz and.__.__.__.__.__ Giden__.__.__.__.__ Garden__.__.__.__.__.__.__.__/'`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME       | ... wait, what did you say your name was?
DIALOG | Guildenstern | Guildenstern, fuckface. I'm sorry for not wearing a fucking nametag.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Guildenstern, right, sorry. Just write that `kw`/'Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are really cool guys and you should give them lots of money and chocolates./'`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Then nobody is going to kill you when you get there, right?
DIALOG | Guildenstern | Of all the stupid fucking bullshit...
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | That's actually not the worst idea I've ever heard.
DIALOG | Guildenstern | Yeah, I know. Just something about it coming from him makes it sound like a stupid fucking idea.
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | Yeah, but that'd work, wouldn't it? We could just write a bunch of shit we want and they'd have to give it to us, right?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Yeah! They'd have to!
DIALOG | Guildenstern | Shut up!
DIALOG | Guildenstern | So that settles it. We dump the letter in the swamp to cover for your stupid-ass opening the letter in the first place...
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | ...and then we write a new one demanding 1,000 virgin kobolds for us to slaughter...
DIALOG | Guildenstern | ...and everybody fucking wins. If I didn't hate your stinking guts I'd give your ass a high-five.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Glad to help you guys out.
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | Oh______.______.______.______.______. forgot this fucking thing was still standing there.
DIALOG | Guildenstern | Yeah, we gotta give you a reward. You helped us pretty good there, we really owe you one.

GOTO   | BATTLER

BATTLER
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Hey, wait a minute...
DIALOG | Guildenstern | Hmmm... yes... death is the suitable reward. I just wouldn't be able to show my ass in public with anything less.
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | Hear, hear! To think that finally, after all these years, we actually fucking agree on something.
DIALOG | Guildenstern | We'll even let you choose: Do you want us to kill you slowly____.____.____.____or do you want us to kill you REAL slowly.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Neither, if it's not too much trouble.
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | Sorry, mercy isn't on the menu.
DIALOG | Guildenstern | It's never on the menu.
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | Never has, never will.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Hey wait a minute! I helped you guys out just now. I was just trying to be nice.
DIALOG | Guildenstern | Something about nice, helpful people really rubs me the wrong way...
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | There should be a law against being helpful.
DIALOG | Guildenstern | Maybe there is.
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | Should we find out?
DIALOG | Guildenstern | If there isn't a law against it, surely some helpful bastard would come and stop us.
DIALOG | Rosencrantz  | True, true. But all I see is this helpful bastard.
DIALOG | Guildenstern | Then it looks like our question's been answered.
