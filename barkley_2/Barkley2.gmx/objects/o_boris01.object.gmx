BOMB_TOOT
DIALOG | P_NAME | Your toots were bombastic!
DIALOG | Boris  | Ah, I am thrilled by your eager adulation. Clap away, `w1`mon petit!`w0` There are none who toot more vigorously than I, for I would toot from atop the highest mountain or chimney. Do not forget my toots, meek and mild youngster. Do not forget my toots.

DIALOG | P_NAME | Sorry...  
QUEST  | borisState = 2

SHIT_TOOT
DIALOG | P_NAME | It was pretty bad.
DIALOG | Boris  | Hmm, what's that? You'll need to speak up, dear jugend. My ears are still ringing from the toots.

JOCK_TOOT
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'm more into jock jams. Know anything that'll get me juiced up to shoot some hoops?
DIALOG | Boris  | Ah, you seek a passepied most potent. I must confess my pipes are not nearly pied enough, though my brainpan, once panned, recalls a pianist in the City of Brains who can accompany your request.

DIALOG | P_NAME | Okay, great, the band definitely needs a flute master. I'm still putting it together, so I'll be a while, but if you head down south to Brain City, I'll meet you there with the others.

BETRAYAL
DIALOG | Boris  | Though your visage is that of the kinder, your deceit betrays your true colors: you are a `s1`knave!`s0` A knave, I say, for allowing me to travel to the City of Brains and never meeting me there! Where were you, youngster? Speak up!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Sorry, Boris... I kinda forgot...
