DIALOG | P_NAME      | Uh, I gotta go, I think I hear my uncle calling for me.
DIALOG | Nick Carter | No no no! Wait! Forget about what I just said. Look, I need some help, okay?
DIALOG | P_NAME      | I agree.
DIALOG | Nick Carter | What? Oh, no no no. I don't mean that sort of help. Look, I was `kw`supposed to meet someone`rt` in here but that person never showed up. I was hoping maybe you would've been that person.
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Sorry, but I'm just a youngster fulfilling my destiny.
DIALOG | Nick Carter | Yes, I figured you aren't the person I'm waiting for. But hey, listen, can you do me a favor? I've got to keep an eye on some things in here but at the same time I really need to meet with this person I'm waiting for. Could you `sq`take a look around Ys-Kolob`rt` and see if you can `sq`find this person?`rt`
CHOICE | Go and find a person?
REPLY  | FIND_YAY | I guess I could...
REPLY  | FIND_NAY | No time for that...

FIND_YAY
DIALOG | P_NAME      | I guess I could keep my eyes open. So who exactly should I be looking for?
DIALOG | Nick Carter | Ah, yes... See, that's part of the problem. I... have no idea who it is that was supposed to meet me here.
DIALOG | P_NAME      | What? How am I supposed to find this person then?
DIALOG | Nick Carter | Look, since I'm in a bit of a bind here I'm going to let you in on a little secret. I'm a `kw`private detective`rt` on a secret co-op mission with the local law enforcement. The person I'm supposed to meet here is an `sq`informant,`rt` someone who has infiltrated deep within the enemy ranks.
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Whoa... Cool.
DIALOG | Nick Carter | Yeah, yeah, just keep your voice down and don't go telling anyone about this. This is top secret stuff. Anyways, I don't know what this person looks like but there is someone else who might... `sq`Father Mowgli.`rt` 
DIALOG | Nick Carter | Yes, that's our best chance. Go to the `kw`local church`rt` and talk to `sq`Father Mowgli.`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Okay, but I'm not making any promises.
DIALOG | Nick Carter | Thank you, and good luck.
