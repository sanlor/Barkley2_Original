DIALOG | Milia | The `kw`Necron 7`rt` has probably been around for a while, huh? Banquo and I just got back from this `kw`big swamp south of here`rt` that had these ancient stone mounds, like `sq`stupas`rt` or something. There were lots of them.

I bet there's somethin' good inside of 'em.
QUEST  | miliaState = 1

MILIA1
DIALOG | Milia | There was all this muck in the swamp that was hard to walk through. When we tried to wade through it, these giant mosquitos would swarm us and we had to run. I don't think we'll go back to the swamp for a while, but I'd like to see those stupas again, find out what's inside...
