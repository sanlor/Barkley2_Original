FIRST_MEETING
DIALOG | Abraham | Begone, knave! Begone! My master has no truck with ill-bred rascals of such low repute! Begone!
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Huh, your master? Who's that?
DIALOG | Abraham | You need not know my master's name, only that he is old and wise, the last of his kind, and that the treasure he guards is among the most precious artifacts in this galaxy. 
DIALOG | Abraham | There is only one to whom I may grant entrance - `mq`a jugend of exceptionally lordly caliber`rt` - and that jugend is not you! So begone, I say! `s1`Begone!`s0`
IF mainQuest &lt; 6 | GOTO | CDWARF
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Alright, I'm going. No need to blow a gasket.
QUEST  | abrahamState = 1

CDWARF
DIALOG | P_NAME  | (Hmm, an old and wise master...)
WAIT   | 0.5
Emote  | !
WAIT   | 0.5
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | (What if it's the Cyberdwarf?!)
WAIT   | 0.5
DIALOG | P_NAME  | I think I need to see your master. It's really important. I don't know how to really phrase this, so uh, here goes... 
DIALOG | P_NAME  | I was trapped inside a big egg for Clisp knows how long, and then I was rescued by some L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S. dwarfs. They told me I needed to find the Cyberdwarf. See, I'm an amnesiac. I don't remember who I am and I think the Cyberdwarf might know. I just need to talk to him. I won't be long.
DIALOG | Abraham | Spare me your laments - I have no use for the tears of a knave! You are not the jugend my master seeks... so begone!
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Dad shuckit...
QUEST  | abrahamState = 1

FIND_PERSON
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Maybe I can help you find the person your master is looking for. I love running errands for people.
DIALOG | Abraham | Though they met only in passing long ago, my master saw within the jugend for whom he awaits a spark unrivalled, a caliber so lordly that any would recognize it upon first sight. 
DIALOG | Abraham | Noble and true, innocent and compassionate, as willful as a rushing river and as brave as a pride of lions. Within the heart of this jugend, my master saw the wherewithal to save the world, to save all of existence. My master has waited for the return of this jugend for many thousands of years so as to bequeath them his greatest treasure, but he grows old and I fear that soon he can wait no longer. 
DIALOG | Abraham | But you are not this jugend, so begone! Begone, knave! `s1`Begone!`s0`
DIALOG | P_NAME  | (Pfft... take a chill pill, dude. Sheesh...)
QUEST  | abrahamState = 2

FIND_PERSON_REPEAT
DIALOG | Abraham | You are NOT the jugend my master seeks! Begone, knave! `s1`Begone!`s0`

MEET_ZALATAR_QUICK
DIALOG | Abraham | Quickly, jugend! There is no time to lose! Go inside the manor to meet my master right away!
               
POST_DEMISE
DIALOG | Abraham | My master's ceaseless agony has finally ended. His suffering has come to an end, as has his need for my attendance. Still, I will stay here for the time being to make sure he gets the burial he deserves, and to tend to his estate and ensure that his legacy is not forgotten. Thank you, youngster... thank you.
