// The well. The player can dump Babby Hubert's organs here. This is a REQUIRED EVENT leading up to the player character getting murdered and impersonated by Fantomas. I should mention that it doesn't NEED to be a well. A well sounded right while I was writing this, so I rolled with it. It can be any place where the player can dump something. HOWEVER, it does need to be an interactable object so this script can handle the loss of the duck organs. Doing so will trigger the Oliver02 script, which is where the Fantomas murder scene officially takes place. Disposing of the organs through any other means WILL NOT trigger the Fantomas events.
// NOTE: We could make this a wishing well or something, I guess, assuming we even keep this as a well. As it stands right now, this well is only there to act as a place where Huey's organs can be dumped.
// NOTE2: In my efforts to keep the Fantomas scenario INSANELY low-impact graphically, I have scripted with the assumption that we don't need a unique animation of the player dumping Huey's organs down the well.
