DIALOG | The Anime Bulldog | What have we here... a new DJ trying to build a name? Better carve your niche and carve it fast, and don't bother with Gluteal-Kei. It's my turf and I will defend it fiercely.

DIALOG | The Anime Bulldog | You want an autograph, kid? Meet me after the show.

ANIME0
DIALOG | The Anime Bulldog | Hey, what's up? Diggin' the track? This is a collab, me versus DJ Booty Slayer. He was basically going for a booty-nouveau feel while I maintained the crispness and punch of modern keisterstep. Hope you like it.
DIALOG | P_NAME            | (W-whoa... I can't believe he talked to me... he's so cool...)
DIALOG | The Anime Bulldog | Speechless, huh? Well stick around for a real show. Don't tell him I said this, but I'm going to crush DJ Booty Slayer in the Bootypocalypse!
