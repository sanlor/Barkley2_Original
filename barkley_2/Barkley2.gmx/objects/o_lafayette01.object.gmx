IMADWARF
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | No way! I'm a dwarf, through and through! I've just got a little more height, than the normal dwarf... and maybe a lot more melanin. 
DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | That's okay. If you think you are a dwarf than you're a dwarf. I don't see why not.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | You think so? Thanks Lafayette. 
DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | No problem, my dwarfen brethren.

IMSOMETHINGELSE
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSad | I-_I think I'm something else... but I don't know what.
DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | I guess we are all trying to figure out what we are. I always thought I was a scout..._ but now I'm looking to be something else. Hopefully something of worth.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSad | Yeah, that's all we can strive for, Lafayette.

LOOKINGFORCYBERDWARF
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'm searching for my destiny... apparently `mq`The Cyberdwarf`rt` can help find it.
DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | Cyber-who?_ Oh you mean the guy who's supposed to be giving us orders?
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | Yeah! I think that's the one! Do you know where he is?

IF operationX &gt;= 5 | DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | Actually no I don't. Besides that `kw`Top Secret Dossier`rt` you brought me, we only get communication through carrier rats and normally the paper is mostly chewed up. We're kinda flying blind here.
IF operationX &lt;= 4 | DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | Actually no I don't. We get all our communication through carrier rats and normally the paper is mostly chewed through. We're kinda flying blind here.
DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | Although I can tell you one thing- `mq`at the top of Gilbert's Peak they say there is a wise Magus`rt` with mystical knowledge so vast that travelers brave the mountains just to get a minute of audience. She was called `kw`Famous Magus`rt` if I remember correctly. `mq`Maybe that's the Cyberdwarf you are looking for?`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hmm, I am pretty sure Cyberdwarf is a guy, but hey, it's the sixties! Gender labels are pretty antiquated.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | `mq`Looks like I'm heading up the mountain!`rt`

DOSSIER_01
DIALOG | P_NAME | Oh! I have something I'm supposed to give to a Lafayette... Since there's no other Lafayette's around here then that must be you. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | Now let's see... which one was it?
GOTO   | NOTE_CHOOSER

DOSSIER_02
DIALOG | P_NAME | Okay, let me see if I have that thing I was supposed to give you.

DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | Wowee! This is some juicy intel! `w1`Juiced to the gills!`w0`
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | Really? What's it say?
DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | Well there's a whole slew of neuroshekels in here... and_ it says we in the `kw`FoopBa`rt` need to keep `kw`Operation: Reverse Dunkirk`rt` going! `w1`Wow..._ Whoah..._ Wow...`w0`
DIALOG | P_NAME         | That's it? What are we supposed to do?
DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | It says..._ `sq`liberate the Hoosegow.`rt`
SURPRISEAT | o_lafayette01
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | `w1`Liberate?`w0` How do we do that?
DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | Looks like HQ figured out a way into the Hoosegow through an underwater stream. We're supposed to `sq`access the stream and then swim into the compound and liberate the inmates!`rt` Sounds risky!

DIALOG | P_NAME         | Well..._ I think it's pretty obvious that I'm gonna do it, right?
DIALOG | Cpl. Lafayette | Yeah, probably. But `sq`I don't think anything can be done until you get those Duergars out of that encampment on the Peak.`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Right... `sq`well I'll do that first then and report back here.`rt`
