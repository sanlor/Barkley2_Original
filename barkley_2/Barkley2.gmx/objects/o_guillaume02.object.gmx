DIALOG | P_NAME    | I remember you... Guillaume, right? I just got here and I'm looking around. I don't know too much about this place yet.
DIALOG | Guillaume | Maaan, Al-Akihabara is great. I don't know why I didn't come here earlier. Can you feel it? The karmic vibes coming from each grain of sand? That oneness with nature that comes from the solitude of the desert, like you're just another one of those grains of sand? That's the cosmic empathy of the universe, man - that thing I've been looking for. I'm not playing for a crowd here... I'm playing for the cosmos. This is the place, man... Al-Akihabara.
DIALOG | P_NAME    | Wow, that's amazing...
DIALOG | Guillaume | Yeaaah, man. Anyway, my point is that there's pretty much no water or food out here, so lemme know if there are any music jobs out there. A dwarf's gotta eat.

RECRUIT_YAY
DIALOG | P_NAME    | Hey, you know, Guillaume, I'm putting together a band to play at a wedding. You wouldn't be interested in playing the guitar for it, would you?
DIALOG | Guillaume | A wedding gig, huh? Sure, could be chill. Gimme the deets, maaaan.
DIALOG | P_NAME    | I'm still putting the band together, but I'll be ready soon. If you want to go to the booty bass club in Brain City, I'll meet you there when everything's set.
DIALOG | Guillaume | Raaaaaad, man. Hope the pay's good. I guess I'll practice with the others while I wait. I'll see you there...
