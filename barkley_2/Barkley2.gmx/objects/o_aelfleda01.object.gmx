QUEST  | aelfledaState = 2
DIALOG | Aelfleda | Okay, here it goes...
DIALOG | Aelfleda | Recently these dwarfs I used to know, Augustine and Gelasio, showed up back in Tir na Nog. Last I heard, the Duergars had banished them to the mines to toil for Cuchulainn eternally... so seeing them was a big surprise. Dwarfs don't usually last too long around here anyway, let alone come back from the mines. But here they were, living large and blowing a lot of shekels. I didn't even know where they got them.
DIALOG | Aelfleda | What a dope I was! I was hanging out with Augustine a few nights ago, and maybe we had a bit too much juice... it's possible. He told me he forgot his billfold, and asked if I would cover the check, that he would pay me back first thing the next day. I said sure, and put it on my tab. It's been days now and no sign of him, anywhere, from anyone! And three people so far have told me he borrowed money from them too. Then he vanishes!
DIALOG | P_NAME | I tell you what... I don't think that's fair to you.
DIALOG | Aelfleda | I know! And it was only @money_aelfledaAug@ neuro-shekels but one, that's a lot to me and two... okay, here it goes...
DIALOG | Aelfleda | Since I didn't pay with cash the other day, the balance got charged to my bank account. This would have been fine. But since I haven't been able to bring that money to the bank, I'll overdraft. Overdraft protection kicks in and tries to cover the overdraft penalty with funds from my savings account. They don't let you turn this off. And really, even at this point, things were still fine.
DIALOG | Aelfleda | My utility payment is automatically deducted from my savings account, so I went down there the other morning with some of my rent money to cover that. Only after they took my money, however, the Duergars running that scam informed me that my balance had dipped below some arbitrary number and there's a /'low balance fee/' of @money_aelfledaFee@ neuro-shekels.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Cripes... that's cold.
DIALOG | Aelfleda | It turns out the low balance fees are issued every day at 11:59 PM, and past zero they become /'insufficient funds penalties/' and which just last night I graduated into something called /'felony debt./'
DIALOG | P_NAME | W-... what kind of place is this?
DIALOG | Aelfleda | So they proceed with eviction, and even that was okay, I do fine right here on the steps. I like the steps. But I got fired from my job after I showed up with no uniform. I told them... /'My uniform is in my apartment, and I got evicted from my apartment./' Really, they wouldn't let me back in! At least with a job I would have been able to pay the Duergars their protection money... for a couple days anyway.
DIALOG | P_NAME | What are you going to do?
DIALOG | Aelfleda | Well, come the next curfew, the Duergars are going to drag me out of here and into the sewers. I don't know what I'm actually going to do.
DIALOG | P_NAME | ... hm. This really uh...
DIALOG | Aelfleda | It sucks. It really sucks. But thanks for listening to all that.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Is there anything I can do?
DIALOG | Aelfleda | Honestly, I think if I sit right here they'll beat me and throw me in the sewers instead of processing all my information and finding out how much I really owe them. At this point, this is probably the best way it can happen.
