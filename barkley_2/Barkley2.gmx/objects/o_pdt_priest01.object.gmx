DIALOG | P_NAME                  | Oh, hey. How's Pocahontas doing?
DIALOG | Father Mowgli Whitewash | She is doing alright, all things considered. But what about you? Is there something you need?
DIALOG | P_NAME                  | Uh, I guess not.

DIALOG | Father Mowgli Whitewash | Kuwabara, child. Welcome to the church of Clispaeth. Are you looking to repent?
IF nickcarterState == 1          | GOTO | INFORMANT
DIALOG | P_NAME                  | Uh, hey. I'm not really sure what that means.
DIALOG | Father Mowgli Whitewash | I'm offering you a spot in the lord's flock, my child. Repent, throw away your sinful ways and you may yet save your soul.
DIALOG | P_NAME                  | Hmm... I do like my soul...
DIALOG | Father Mowgli Whitewash | We all love our souls, as does Clispaeth. But I sense that you are not perhaps convinced of the lord's everlasting grace.
DIALOG | P_NAME                  | I haven't really thought about it, but I'm kinda busy now anyway.
DIALOG | Father Mowgli Whitewash | Ah... The distractions of youth. You will find the lord's grace in due time, as do we all. Oh, but before you go, are you perhaps familiar with `sq`The Good Book?`rt` 
DIALOG | P_NAME                  | The Good Book? You mean like the bible or something?
DIALOG | Father Mowgli Whitewash | Ah, I gather you are not too familiar with the subject... Still, if it isn't too much trouble I'd like to ask a small favor from you, youngster.

FAVOR_SETUP
DIALOG | P_NAME                  | Umm, what sort of a favor?
DIALOG | Father Mowgli Whitewash | Nothing major. Are you perhaps familiar with `sq`The Good Book?`rt` 
DIALOG | P_NAME                  | The Good Book? You mean like the bible or something?

DIALOG | P_NAME                  | Actually, I'm looking for someone. Or rather, someone else is looking for someone. Have you seen anyone around here who could be an informant?
DIALOG | Father Mowgli Whitewash | Oh, an informant, you say? I'm not sure if I've seen such a person but `sq`/'oh, the forests of Fary sure has changed!/'`rt`

DIALOG | P_NAME                  | O-okay...

FAVOR_YAY
DIALOG | P_NAME                  | I guess it would be heresy to say no to a priest.
DIALOG | Father Mowgli Whitewash | Ha ha ha... What a delightful observation. But alas now is not the time for philosophies. You see, The Good Book has only a limited number of proverbs and I'm afraid my Parish has already heard the mall a thousand times. I was hoping that perhaps you could help me come up with some new ones.
DIALOG | P_NAME                  | Hmm, proverbs, huh? Not really my strongest suite.
DIALOG | Father Mowgli Whitewash | Oh, that's quite alright, my child. I'm only looking for suggestions and inspiration. If you can think of anything at all that you think would help me then I would love to hear it.
