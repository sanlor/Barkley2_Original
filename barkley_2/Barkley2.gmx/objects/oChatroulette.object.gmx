PARTNER: Youngster! By Clispaeth's mercy, is your mind completely deranged?
PARTNER: You yourself pointed out the location! Go to the facility located north of the Eastelands, the one where you were being held in an egg-stasis.
YOU: Oh, right. Okay, I'm on it.

YOU: Hey Cyberdwarf, any idea where I should go next?
PARTNER: Just a moment, youngster. 
PARTNER: ...
PARTNER: Yes, I think I might be onto something. Our spy satellites are detecting high levels of Cyberium radiation in the Eastelands. 
YOU: What does that mean? Is it a Cyberspear piece?
PARTNER: It's impossible to know for sure.
YOU: Wow.
PARTNER: Hmm, I can't get an exact fix on the origin of this radiation. There is too much Magnetic Interference of some sort.
YOU: So where should I go then?
PARTNER: I believe the best course of action is to visit any and all communities in the Eastelands for more insight into the matter.

YOU: Whoa...
PARTNER: I have received reports about Cuchulainn running a mining operation at the base of Gilbert's Peak, the dreadful mountain east of Tir Na Nog.
PARTNER: I believe one of the pieces is down there, cradled deep within the Ziggurat's crust. It's only a matter of time before Cuchulainn's diabolical henchmen get their hands on the piece.
PARTNER: One of my L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S. idiots, Variable, is on the scene self-investigating. Talk to him for futher information.
YOU: This sounds like a dangerous assignment.
PARTNER: It most certainly is. Luckily for us Cuchulainn has his cronies spread thin all over Necron 7. There won't be enough duergars there to stop you.
PARTNER: Go now, child. You must find the piece before Cuchulainn gets his disgusting hands on it. 
YOU: Whoa, Cyberdwarf. Chill out, dude.
