CHIDED_TOO_MUCH
DIALOG | Frampton | I've chided you one too many times. Get out of my sight.

FRIENDLY
DIALOG | Frampton | Hello, P_NAME. Back for some more O.O.?
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Mayhaps, Frampton. Mayhaps.
DIALOG | Frampton | Hah. Same ol' P_NAME._ Enjoy your stay.

FRAMPTON_4
DIALOG | Frampton | Oligarchy Online isn't just a mere virtual literal social media stratum simulator and currency exchanger. It's a way of life, and a way of unlife.

FRAMPTON_0
DIALOG | Frampton | Just like everyone else. You can sign up for an account upstairs at the Intra-Reality Annex. Cosette can get you started with an Oligarchy Online account.

OO_QUESTIONS

IF knowDwarfNET &gt;= 1 | IF knowOO == 0 | REPLY | IS_IT_LIKE_DNET | Is this like DwarfNET?
REPLY  | MAYBE_LATER | Nah, I'm good.

IS_THIS_OO
DIALOG | P_NAME   | What is all this?
DIALOG | Frampton | All this? Well it depends on how much time you have to kill.
CHOICE | Got time to kill?
REPLY  | LOADS_OF_TIMES | Loads. Tell me what I need to do.
REPLY  | MAYBE_LATER    | Work's got me by the orbs, maybe later!

LOADS_OF_TIMES
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Time is on my side. What are these machines?
DIALOG | Frampton | These are the Technorganic Interface Stations for Oligarchy Online. The premiere online experience on Necron 7. 
DIALOG | Frampton | You've never heard of these?
DIALOG | P_NAME   | No, can't say that I have.
DIALOG | Frampton | They are the most state of the art machines this side of the galaxy, capable of fulfilling anyone's wildest dreams and ambitions. And Oligarchy Online? A superb masterpiece of gaming technology hatched by the most brilliant of dwarf minds.
DIALOG | Frampton | Many historians and ancient scholars say that the moment when O.O. was first introduced to the Technorganic Interface Stations of Necron 7 was the moment when history was split into two eras: Pre-Oligarchy and Post-Oligarchy.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Wow, sounds like people really love this stuff.
DIALOG | Frampton | More than you could ever know. Now, was there something else?

DIALOG | Frampton | For Oligarchy Online? Just head upstairs and talk to Cosette. She'll have you hooked up in no time.

IF framptonChides &gt;= 1 | DIALOG | Frampton | Clispaeth's Poker! What did I just tell you?! Watch your tongue! Loose lips scratch discs. Look, I'm not a reb, but I sympathize. And the last thing I do is endanger the safety of my patrons by running my gums.

DIALOG | P_NAME   | Oh sorry.
DIALOG | Frampton | It's called OPSEC. Anyways, if you want to know just ask him.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Ask him? He doesn't look like he's gonna be able to answer too much here.

IS_IT_LIKE_DNET
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Is this like jacking into DwarfNET?
DIALOG | Frampton | Easy with the D-word! You never know who's listening. No this is NOT that. O.O. is tied directly to the eco-balance here on Necron 7.
QUEST  | framptonChides += 1
DIALOG | P_NAME   | So what does it do, exactly?       
DIALOG | Frampton | What doesn't it do? Pay your rent, feed your cat, vote for absolutely anything gubernatorial. You whole life is in O.O.. Vidcons if you want them.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | I love Vidcons!                   
DIALOG | Frampton | Well those are probably coming once Oligarchy Online reaches Beta. Right now users are restricted to Early Access Intra-Reality Purchasing and Virtual Libations. If you think about it for a really long time, you'll see that it's the best way to get access to your favorite brands.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Sounds complicated.
DIALOG | Frampton | It's not too bad once you realize you need it.

MORE_INFO
CHOICE | Need more info?
REPLY  | TELL_ME_MORE | Yeah I have a few more questions.
REPLY  | TELL_ME_LESS | No thanks.

TELL_ME_MORE
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | Actually, a few more questions. 
DIALOG | Frampton | I guess this is what they pay me for. What do you want to know?                
GOTO   | OO_QUESTIONS

TELL_ME_LESS
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'm just admiring your steady hand. See you.

CHIDE_MAXIMUM
DIALOG | Frampton | What you made was a sore error. I'll look the other way when you can't keep your mouth shut to protect a dwarf, but when you lie to me, that's when I realize all my chidings fall on deaf ears. Get lost.

I_HATE_OO
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | Honestly, every moment that I'm logged out of Oligarchy Online is a moment I cherish. The experience was slipshod and empty, something I thought I never would live through again after having an account with /'Gem Barrio: The World is Yours/'.

DIALOG | P_NAME   | Phew.
QUEST  | framptonState = 3

I_HATE_OO_SCAM
DIALOG | Frampton | Look I've seen a lot of dwarfs come in and out of these chairs. And they all leave with a sliver of color missing from their eyes. Like they leave a piece of their soul inside.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Yeah and-.
DIALOG | Frampton | And you still have that sliver, that piece of yourself. You've never gone in. You've never visited O.O.. You're telling tales and flabbin' gums.

OO_LOGGED_IN
DIALOG | Frampton | Oh nothing, I just thought you would deride the graphics and features as barely passable for even a prototype. And that there is nothing to actually DO in Oligarchy Online. That it's just a communal bonfire of neuro-shekels, everydwarf throwing in their share just to impress the others on how much higher the flames reach.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Oh... No I thought it was pretty neat.

Frampton is the steward of the VRW Station Area.
He looks after the people that are stuck in VRW but still have the mortal needs in Brain City.
It would be great if he was applying Hydrating Gel into a VRW users mouth.
He feels like he's stuck in Diner Dash.  This could only really be pulled off if he has a cool dashing animation so the alternative is:
He jusy hates his job.
