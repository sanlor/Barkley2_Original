DIALOG | Orgoid | Hello again. I think I've made some headway when it comes to my new name... er, my first name.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Really!? That's great! What are you thinking?
DIALOG | Orgoid | Well, I have a few ideas. Are you ready? ... here we go: /'" + string(name1) + "/'... /'" + string(name2) + "/'... or /'" + string(name3) + "/'... So? What do you think?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Oh... those are the options? Uh...
CHOICE | Which name?
REPLY  | NAME_1    | " + string(name1) + ".
REPLY  | NAME_2    | " + string(name2) + ".
REPLY  | NAME_3    | " + string(name3) + ".
REPLY  | NAME_NONE | None of those.

NAME_NONE
IF orgoidRejected == 0 | GOTO | REJECTION_0
IF orgoidRejected == 1 | GOTO | REJECTION_1
IF orgoidRejected == 2 | GOTO | REJECTION_2

REJECTION_0
DIALOG | P_NAME | Well, honestly, I don't really like any of those.
DIALOG | Orgoid | Really? I thought those would work as names... maybe I'm not very good at this.
DIALOG | P_NAME | No, don't worry! Just think about it a little bit more I guess. You can name yourself anything! You don't wanna rush it, right?
DIALOG | Orgoid | I suppose that's true. Thanks for the advice, P_NAME.
QUEST  | orgoidRejected += 1  
  
REJECTION_1
DIALOG | P_NAME | To tell you the truth, none of those are doing it for me either.
DIALOG | Orgoid | You know, it's hard to tell what a name is when you've never had one before.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I didn't mean it like that, just...
DIALOG | Orgoid | It's fine, I'll just have to keep thinking.
QUEST  | orgoidRejected += 1  

REJECTION_2
DIALOG | P_NAME | I uh... I don't know if you should use any of those.
DIALOG | Orgoid | I see. No, really, I totally get it. You've got a name, and you're just defending your turf, aren't you?
DIALOG | P_NAME | What? No, I...
DIALOG | Orgoid | Please, spare me. I'm not even sure I want a name. I'm just Orgoid. Happy now?
DIALOG | P_NAME | I didn't mean it like that.
DIALOG | Orgoid | ...
QUEST  | orgoidRejected += 1    

POST_REJECTION
IF orgoidRejected == 1 | DIALOG | Orgoid | My name... I must keep thinking about this.
IF orgoidRejected == 2 | DIALOG | Orgoid | Stupid... stupid... next time I will have a better name.
IF orgoidRejected == 3 | DIALOG | Orgoid | Orgoid... I am Orgoid... I am an Orgoid...

NAME_1

DIALOG | Orgoid | Really? You do?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah, it rules! Go with it!
DIALOG | Orgoid | Okay... my name is._._._ " +string(orgoidName)+ "
DIALOG | P_NAME | You're gonna be happy with it. Trust me!
DIALOG | Orgoid | Thanks for inspiring me to do this, P_NAME.
    
ORGOID_0
DIALOG | Orgoid | Hm? Are you...? No, of course not. I thought you belonged here, like me.
DIALOG | P_NAME | What are you talking about?
DIALOG | Orgoid | I misread you. I was mistaken. I'm an Orgoid.

ORGOID_1
DIALOG | Orgoid | Look upon me. Do you realize what you are seeing? I'm all flesh and blood, but there's a computer in my skull, and a real one too. No brain here, just a functional silicon wafer.
                
ORGOID_2
DIALOG | Orgoid | You've run into lots of cyborgs I'm sure... but there's nothing dwarf about me. I'm a robot and more. Orgoid is what I am called.
DIALOG | P_NAME | An orgoid... that's cool, and really original! I guess you're right, I've never met one of you before. What's your name, orgoid?
DIALOG | Orgoid | I'm Orgoid.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I know you're an orgoid, but what's your name?
DIALOG | Orgoid | Name?... Orgoid is all I call myself. I've never met another orgoid from which to distinguish myself.

DIALOG | P_NAME | Nice to meet you Orgoid. For what it's worth, I'm called P_NAME, but I'm not sure if that's my real name or what. Maybe I don't have a name either.
scr_event_build_dialogue(orgoidname, orgoidport, P_NAME is something though. At least it's not just /'cyborg/'... or /'orgoid./' I wish my name was P_NAME...
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'm sorry, Orgoid. It's not a great name, really. I promise. I'm sure you'll have a name one day, and it'll be a good one.
DIALOG | Orgoid | ...
// orgoidState = 1
scr_event_build_quest_state(orgoidState, 1

DIALOG | P_NAME | Really? What are you gonna do if you meet another orgoid? You should try to pull a name together before that happens, so you can tell who's who.
DIALOG | Orgoid | It has not happened yet, but I am not sure. What's your name? How can I have one?
    
// player == hoopz
if (scr_quest_get_state("playerHoopz") == 1) {
DIALOG | P_NAME | Well, most of the time you get names from your family... that's why I'm called " + P_NAME_F + " anyway. Do you have a family?
DIALOG | Orgoid | I have no family, not that I am aware of.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yikes... that makes it tougher. Hm._._. oh, I know! No matter what your family calls you, everyone's entitled to a nickname. And those you can choose by yourself!
DIALOG | Orgoid | So... I can just decide? Anything I want?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Usually it has something to do with your real name, or something that you're already called. If it's too out there, it won't stick.
DIALOG | Orgoid | I see, I see... I'll have to think on this awhile, then.
// orgoidState = 2
scr_event_build_quest_state(orgoidState, 2);

// player == cc
DIALOG | P_NAME | Well, sometimes you get names from your family... but mine is " + P_NAME + " and I decided that myself. You can choose a name for yourself too, if you want.
DIALOG | Orgoid | I have no family, not that I am aware of. I think that choosing outright is my only option. So... are you sure I can just decide?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Oh yeah! Think of a name you want to have, say you want to go by it, start going by it, and boom! It's yours... and it's you!
DIALOG | Orgoid | This is... fascinating, but all very new to this orgoid. I'll have to deliberate on this, then.

DIALOG | P_NAME | Hello. Well actually, I'm not X114JAM9 anymore. I found out my name is really P_NAME_F.
DIALOG | Orgoid | Really? P_NAME is a nice name. I'll be sure to call you that then. So... what's going on with X114JAM9? It's not free is it?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Well, um, I guess you ca-
scr_event_build_dialogue(P_NAME, orgoidport, Well then, it's decided. I'm X114JAM9. I'm an orgoid. Nice to meet you, P_NAME.

DIALOG | P_NAME | Hi Orgoid. Wait, are you okay?
DIALOG | Orgoid | You have a name... I do not. Please leave me in peace.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Orgoid...
DIALOG | Orgoid | X114JAM9... before you talked to me, I didn't know I was missing anything. I was fine as an orgoid, and as Orgoid. I was happy. Now there is a hole where a name should be, and not just at this moment. I'm scanning my files, going through my memories, and while only finite amounts of data are stored there, this absence is a new addition. A lack that was not there before, with no data to describe it, but still making it's presence known.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'm so sorry, Orgoid...
DIALOG | Orgoid | It's like that all the way back. Whenever and wherever I remember being orgoid, I now remember being nameless, although the memory does not exist. I must do something about this... but I do not know what.

DIALOG | Orgo   | You're back! Notice anything different about me?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hmm... not really.
DIALOG | Orgo   | My nickname, silly! I'm Orgo now!... Er, I meant to say: /'I'm Orgoid... but you can call me Orgo!/' That's how you do nicknames, right?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah, that's it exactly! I'm happy for you Orgo. That's a great nickname.
DIALOG | Orgo   | You think so? Man oh man, I've felt different ever since I got this name. Like I'm more fun or something... Orgoid was pretty stodgy. Orgo can do anything.
                
DIALOG | Orgoid | A nickname... I need to think about this more.
