DIALOG | P_NAME | Hey, this is a pretty cool song. What's it called?
DIALOG | Garcia | Y-you don't recognize it? It's Sorry Tuesday, my biggest hit! It was #1 on the charts back in 663X...
DIALOG | P_NAME | Oh... I've kinda been out of it for a while. I guess I missed it.
DIALOG | Garcia | Oh yeah, Lemon Squeeze - that was my band back then - we were real big in the chill ghosthouse neopopwave scene. Always on tour, always on the charts... Yeah, things were good for us back then. O-oh, they're still good! Y-yeah, things are great! Hey, you want an autograph or something? A CD? My new stuff is still fresh. You want me to play for you? Want a studio musician? Someone to play for a party? Whatever, I'll do it, I'll play any gig. Just 5 neuro-shekels.

DIALOG | Garcia | H-hey man, spare a dime? A nickel? Wanna buy a CD? Hey, hey, you want an autograph, don't you? Y-you know me, right? Garcia from Lemon Squeeze? We were really big 30 years ago, my solo stuff is still fresh. Need a keyboardist? Anything?
DIALOG | P_NAME | (Wow, this guy is SUPER desperate... but he might make a good addition to my band...)

DIALOG | P_NAME | Maybe you need this more than I do... just don't spend it on chups.
DIALOG | Garcia | H-hey man, I kicked my habit a long time ago. Th-thanks anyway. Hey, I'm always willing to play if you ever need a keyboardist if you've ever got a band going or anything.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't really have anything going on at the moment... I'm kind of on a really important quest...
DIALOG | Garcia | O-okay... don't forget me if you need a keyboardist though - I work cheap!!

DIALOG | P_NAME | Here, maybe you need this more than I do - oh, huh, looks like I don't have any money either. Sorry man.
DIALOG | Garcia | I-it's okay... hey - don't forget, I'll play any event you want, parties, weddings, I'll write you jingles, play all my old hits, whatever! I work for cheap, just tell me where you want me!

BREAKOUT | clear
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hey, sorry pal but I don't really have any money. I'd give you some if I had any.
DIALOG | Garcia | I-it's okay... hey - don't forget, I'll play any event you want, parties, weddings, I'll write you jingles, play all my old hits, whatever! I work for cheap, just tell me where you want me!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah, sure, I won't forget... (Geez, this guy seems pretty desperate...)

RECRUIT_YAY
DIALOG | P_NAME | You know, I actually do have some work for you. I'm putting together a group for a wedding party - think you'd be able to play some keyboards for us?
DIALOG | Garcia | A-a gig? You... you really want me? I mean- yeah! Yeah, I'll do it! Where do I have to go?
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'm still putting the band together, but I'll be ready soon. If you want to go to the booty bass club in Brain City, I'll meet you there when everything's set.
DIALOG | Garcia | O-oh man... I haven't played a gig this big in years. I'll be there soon! Th-thanks pal!

DIALOG | P_NAME | O-oops... I think I forgot...
DIALOG | Garcia | You know who I am? I'm Garcia, the keyboardist from Lemon Squeeze. I'm a VIP, man! A music VIP! You can't just... you can't just... just... leave me alone, okay? Leave me alone...
