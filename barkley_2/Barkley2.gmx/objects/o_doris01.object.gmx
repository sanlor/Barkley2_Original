GOVERNOR
DIALOG | Doris | So you're the new Duergar Governor? Here's a hardball for you: `sq`What's your fruit policy?`rt`
DIALOG | Governor Elagabalus | It's my staunch belief that all fruits are equal. That is what all authenthic Duergars believe.

GOVQUEST
DIALOG | Doris | Wow! The new Duergar Governor wasn't so bad after all. He seemed like a genuine fruitlover. Maybe things are getting better around here.

CURFEW
DIALOG | Doris | Hi. Have you heard the latest rumor going around? It's about grapes. I haven't heard it yet.

DORIS00
DIALOG | Doris | Have you heard the news? The new `kw`Duergar Governor`rt` is coming soon and he's going to make a speech! 
DIALOG | Doris | Do you think it'll be about Cuchulainn's prize? Do you think it will be about grapes?
QUEST  | dorisState = 1

DORIS01
DIALOG | Doris | I wonder if those Duergars are `sq`ever going to find those L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S.-types in the sewers...`rt` Seems like a big runaround to me.
KNOW   | knowLONGINUSTnn | 1
QUEST  | dorisState = 2

DORIS02
DIALOG | Doris | I hear this is so much overcrowding here in Tir na nog that they are packing more dwarfs into a place in the `kw`Eastelands`rt` called `kw`The Social.`rt` 
DIALOG | Doris | I wonder if their water tastes less like blood and rust.

QUEST  | dorisState = 0

BOOTY
DIALOG | Doris  | I can't believe it! All that power! All that-_ `w1`that-_ that_`w0` `w2`Booty!`w0` The Bootypocalypse has come and gone but the world will never again be the same. Such a world and `w1`tuckus-shattering`w0` event!
DIALOG | P_NAME | What do you mean?
DIALOG | Doris  | Can't you feel it? A barrage of booty energies are still reverberating from within the Booty Dimension. Wh-whoa!
SURPRISEAT | o_doris01
SHAKE  | 5 | 1
WAIT   | 1.5
DIALOG | Doris  | You feel that? `w1`A booty aftershock...`rt` the ground's still quaking and the asses are still shaking. 
DIALOG | Doris  | Did you feel that bass echoing from the `kw`Booty Dimension?!`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | Y-yes! That was amazing!
