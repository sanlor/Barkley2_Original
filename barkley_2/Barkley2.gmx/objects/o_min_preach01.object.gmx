GLOVES_ABUSE_0
DIALOG | Preach | Oh, uh... Hello._ Sorry, I'm not really in the mood to talk after having to watch that poor dwarf get tormented once again.
QUEST  | preachState = 1

GLOVES_ABUSE_1
DIALOG | Preach | I'm glad I'm not a proboscis dwarf.

PREACH_0
DIALOG | Preach | Why hello there young fella! Welcome to the Mines!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Thanks.
DIALOG | Preach | We don't get that many new faces around here no more. I guess those duergs are finally starting to run out of proboscus dwarfs to ship down here.
DIALOG | Preach | Anyways, I'm `sq`Preach, the mysterious turkey-canary`rt` on Cuchulainn's payroll. My job is to constantly monitor the `kw`carbon monoxide`rt` levels in here.
DIALOG | P_NAME | You're working for Cuchulainn?
DIALOG | Preach | That's right! The one and only. Well, I'm not sure if it's `w1`THE Cuchulainn.`w0` I mean I've heard that there's more than one. 
DIALOG | Preach | The contract they made me sign mentioned that `w1`A Cuchulainn`w0` will torture and destruct all canaries and turkey-canaries who do not meet their daily work quota.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Oh..._ Sounds horrible._ Why are you inside that cage?
DIALOG | Preach | Safety regulations.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Huh? What's that supposed to mean?
DIALOG | Preach | The cage protects me from all bows and arrows, and the wrath of the duergars.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Right._ I, uh, I gotta go man. I'll see you later.
DIALOG | Preach | Alright, take care.
QUEST  | preachState = 1

PREACH_1
DIALOG | Preach | Hey, what can I do for you? Do you need a carbon monoxide reading?
DIALOG | P_NAME | No, I was just in the neighbourhood and thought I should come and see how you are doing.
DIALOG | Preach | Wow! Thanks a lot! That's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Well, uh, I guess that's all. See you later.
DIALOG | Preach | Alright, good luck!

PREACH_2
DIALOG | Preach | `w1`*Cough*`w0` Wow, it sure is... dank in here. `w1`*Cough*`w0`
DIALOG | P_NAME | You alright in there?
DIALOG | Preach | `w1`*Cough*`w0` I'll... manage. It's just this spike in the levels of carbon monoxide and sulphur fumes... `w1`*Cough*`w0`
DIALOG | Preach | Nothing that I can't handle though!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hmm. I guess you're good. Okay, I'll see you later.
DIALOG | Preach | Okay! Have a great day!
