PAY_OPTION_1
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Tell me about the Unlimited Plan, please.

DIALOG | Cosette | Hourly fees are assessed at the incept of your billing cycle, which is NOW, and you'll need to authorize your neuro-shekel bank to automatically debit for each hour spent in Oligarchy Online. That's `sq`@money_ooHourly@ neuro-shekels.`rt`

PAY_OPTION_3
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Tell me about the Pay-As-You-Pwn Plan, please.
DIALOG | Cosette | For a premium rate, you can forgo a payment plan and connect your neural currency bank directly to our digi-ducats servers and navigate through Oligarchy Online through the power of microtransactions. 
DIALOG | Cosette | You'll need to authorize just like in the other plans, but you'll only be charged a starting fee of `sq`@money_ooPayp_Reup@ neuro-shekels`rt` to begin, and then charged the same `kw`re-up`rt` fee each time you need ducats.
