"This is a tale of something that happened to me three years ago. I can only hope that writing down the happenings of that F.A.T.E.ful day, to tell you my story, won't drive me insane.##
It was a pleasent summer day. Sun was shining, people were waking around town with smiles on their faces. They loved the summer. Me too. I really liked summer 
more than any other season of the year. That's because we get a long break from school, and I can focus on playing vidcons. I didn't know it then, but i was about 
to enter Hell itself...##

I had just arrived home and after taking out the garbage I went to my room. My brother had just lef to a summer camp so I took his Funmaster and some games for it. 
First I played some Dragon Knightz II as a warm up for the main course: Blood Killer. I had not heard of this vidcon before despite being a big vidcon enthusiast. 
I put the tape into my brothers Funmaster and turned it on. The game loaded for exactly 12.4 seconds, and then showed a title screen. Blood Killer. What a cool name. 
That's what I thought back then. If only I had known...##

The title screen seemed fairly normal. I checked the options menu and set my controls and graphics settings. I toggled off dithering and anti-alias, mostly because 
I enjoy the more pixelated look of older games. I tinkered with the options for 45 seconds and then went back to the title screen. I selected new game. An intro 
video started playing. It was an anime style intro showing all the characters in the game. Yukoz, the dark brawler, Zatorah, the swordsman, Oplop, the wrestler, 
Sakura, the beautiful magician who was my favorite character, and last but not least Herbert, the reigning Blood Killer. The intro seemed to have ended, when suddenly 
out of nowhere there was a loud scream. I nearly jumped off my chair. I calmed down after 7 seconds and thought that it must've been the game.##

It soon became clear that Blood Killer was one of those roughhousing games that were really popular form of e-sports back then. But somehow, I had not heard of this 
game before. There was no let's plays of it, no reviews on dwaftube by BigBangGamer or Helios666 and no articles on Game Castle or even Let's Play Monthly. Strange. 
After I had searched information about this game on Dwarfnet for 10 minutes and 13 seconds I turned back to my brothers Funmaster and continued playing Blood Killer.##
 
I first picked the campaign for Sakura because she was really beatiful and I wanted to protect her no matter what. I easily defeated Zatorah and Oplop, but Yukoz 
gave me some trouble because of his shadow tonfa move. After a few conttinues I managed to beat him too. Now it was the time to face the last opponent, Herbert. Just 
as the round was about to start the power in our house went down. It startlet me a little but the power came back in 16 seconds. To my surprise I noticed that the 
game hadn't reseted. Me and Sakura were both still about to face Herbert. But something was off. Normally the characters name is displayed next to the characters 
health and tonfa bars, so for me it should say Sakura, since that was the character I was playing as. However, the name said Prepare to die Duffrey. I screamed. 
How did this game know my name? I tried to shut the game off but couldn't. The Funmaster wouldn't shut down, even after I removed the power cable. What the heck 
is going on. That's what I thought to myself back then.##

Suddenly, a deep, sinister voice spoke to me. It said: 'Hello Duffrey. Welcome to this world. The world of Blood Killer...'. I tried to run out of my room but the 
door was locked. I yelled for my parents but it seemed like no one was there. Then I regognized that digitized voice. It was Herbert, the reigning Blood Killer. Had 
I have been sucked into the game during the power outage? After 9 seconds Herbert materialized out my brothers Funmaster and challenged me to a fight. I was no match for him, 
no way. I begged him to let me go, but he wouldn't listen. Then I heard a loud voice. Round 1, Fight. It was the blood Killer announcers voice, announcing the first round. 
Blood Killer Herbert leaped across the room with a tornado kick that sent me to the wall. I coughed up hyper realistic blood, eventhough I had turned off anti-alias and 
dithering. I lied there for 3 seconds and then I yelled out for Sakura in panic. I stood no chance against Herbert. Sakura was my only hope. But she didn't come. Herbert 
gave me a devilish smirk and started powring up his tonfa. SAKURA, I yelled. No answer. This was it. My end. Herbert let out a warcry and spindashed me with his tonfa. 
The power of the impact decapitated me, and killed me. On my last seconds, I could see an illusion of Sakura fading out. The last thing I heard before dying was the announcer 
saying 'Game over'. He was right...
