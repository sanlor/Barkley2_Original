DIALOG | Poly   | Man, nobody around here wants to rock. You catch Dinah over there on the other side of town with those fake-ass electronic drums? I'm so sick of her shit. She thinks she's all hard or whatever because she's got those drums that practically play themselves while I'm over here busting my ass. Can you imagine what The Scrudlords would've sounded like with electronic drums? Or Manic Ringworms? Or even The Rancid Cockroaches?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Not nearly as boppin'.
DIALOG | Poly   | Damn straight! I've been trying to get a band together, somethin' really rockin', somethin' with that killer edge but all anyone wants to hear anymore is soft rock synthpop bullshit. What the hell happened to that in-your-face oi! oi! oi! rock, huh? Man, I'm gettin' all steamed up. Fuck Dinah and fuck that soft shit! That's all I've gotta say about that.

You know that girl Dinah on the other side of town with those electric drums? Fuck her! I'm so sick of her synthpop bullshit. She thinks she's all that because her drums practically play themselves.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Drums like that can be pretty cool sometimes (except in country and rap).
DIALOG | Poly   | Yeah, whatever. I just wanna get a hardcore crust punk band goin' but nobody in the area wants to start one. All anyone seems to care about is Dinah's stale fuckin' synthpop! It's a real bummer, man.

ROCKER_SOFT
DIALOG | P_NAME | Heck yeah I'm a rocker! A SOFT ROCKER! Go mellow or go home!
DIALOG | Poly   | Man, forget you! I only care about that hard shit, stuff like The Turgid Brigade and The Cretins. You see Dinah, that girl on the other side of town with those electric drums? Fuck her! I'm over here busting my ass while her drums practically play themselves! Go hang out with her if you want to listen to that soft rock bullshit 'cuz I wanna rock!

DIALOG | Poly   | Krumptronica? What the fuck is that? I wanna rock, man, not that bzzt-tss-bzzt-tss hyper-intellectual bullshit made by stern German dudes! That old school, in-your-face oi! oi! oi! kinda rock! You catch Dinah, that girl on the other side of town with those electric drums that practically play themselves? Fuck her! I'm sick of that soft shit!

DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah, sure, I guess. I mean, that's why I'm asking you. I figured you'd wanna rock out. Go to the booty bass club in Brain City if you're interested, I'm still putting the band together. I'll be by when everything's ready.
