We then draw out their power and wisdom and take it for ourselves. Some use this power for good, others for evil...

DIALOG | P_NAME    | What? Are you out of your flippin' gourd? 
DIALOG | Gerz-Nutz | No, not at all. There are many `sq`fertile spots down here`rt` that you can use to sow the seeds. All you have to do is find them.

DIALOG | Gerz-Nutz | Yes, indeed they have. `sq`The Elders`rt` warned me of the corrupting power of the zaubers, but I did not listen. My unsatiable lust for power turned me into what you see before you today.
DIALOG | P_NAME    | Whoa... I'd better steer clear from zaubers.
DIALOG | Gerz-Nutz | No, that is not true! Too much of a good thing can destroy you but if you tread with care, you will be safe. I did not realize the warning signs until it was too late. With every Magick spell thrown from my magick wand my `kw`GLAMP deteriorated.`rt` I grew weaker and weaker when my goal was to become stronger. Heh, you see the irony, yes?
DIALOG | P_NAME    | Look, I appreciate the warning but if using zaubers turns you into a shrubbery then I don't want to go anywhere near them.  
DIALOG | Gerz-Nutz | I can tell you are wise beyond your years, youngster. But you need not be alarmed by the power of the zaubers. `kw`Each time you tap into their power your GLAMP gets demolished,`rt` that is true, but this effect is `kw`only temporary.`rt` Use zaubers sparingly, and no harm will come to you.
