SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | talk

SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | talk
DIALOG | Cyberdwarf | That is true, P_NAME, you handily defeated his first form and for that I commend you. But it was merely his weakest manifestation and Cuchulainn remains vigilant. I hesitate to burden one so young with a task of such magnitude, but there is no other recourse. There is but one way to forever defeat Cuchulainn: the Cyberspear of Destiny.

PART_3
DIALOG | P_NAME | The Cyberspear of Destiny? What's that?
SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | talk
DIALOG | Cyberdwarf | The Gae Bolg, Ascalon, the Lance of Longinus... the Cyberspear of Destiny, the ancient javelin of monumental power once wielded by Cuchulainn himself. Since the time of my imprisonment on Necron 7, I have tasked L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S. with keeping three things safe. My potent kernel, the location of the Cyberspear, and the life of you - the one F.A.T.E.d to wield it.
SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | idle
DIALOG | P_NAME | Okay. Where can we find it?
SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | talk
DIALOG | Cyberdwarf | It has been kept from Cuchulainn and his dreaded Bainshees in the AI Ruins, an elephant graveyard of artificial intelligence modules long forgotten. His minions haven't yet looked there, perhaps because of the perils they present.
SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | idle
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'm not afraid. Just tell me how to get there.
SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | talk
DIALOG | Cyberdwarf | You must temper your bravado with caution, child! To reach the AI Ruins is no easy feat, and to survive them is an even greater task. They can be reached through the Undersewer tunnels that sprawl beneath the whole of the Necron 7. But there are other ways as well...

DIALOG | P_NAME | Okay!_ Wait, how will you meet me there if you are in that tube?_ Does that mean...
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | ARE YOU COMING WITH ME?!

DIALOG | Cyberdwarf | Cuchulainn's Cronies scour the entirety of Necron 7 looking for both of us. They search not only the floor, but the airwaves as well. Communication of the dwarfs has gone_ LOW TECH.
SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | idle
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | Like MORSE CODE?!
SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | talk

SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | talk
DIALOG | Cyberdwarf | The technology was called /'Wi-Fi,/' also known as the /'Wilfred Fidelis Protocols./' Used at the time of the first Cyberpocalypse... Cuchulainn was imprisoned at the time and is unaware of Wi-Fi's shadowy existence.
SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | idle
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | Wow... arcane tech...
SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | talk
DIALOG | Cyberdwarf | We will use these Wi-Fi Protocols for encrypted communications... I instructed Variable to install routers, devices necessary for our desired communications. For some reason they do not work but you must find them and complete their installation. Only then will you gain the power of the ancient Wi-Fi Communication Arts.
SET    | o_cdwarfHead01 | idle
DIALOG | P_NAME | I-_I won't let you down Cyberdwarf!
