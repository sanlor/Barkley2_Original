DIALOG | Cuthbert | G-governor! Oh, uh, I wasn't expecting you to visit my humble shop. Otherwise I would've cleaned up this mess.
DIALOG | Governor Elagabalus | At ease citizen. I am not here to stir up trouble. I'm the governor after all, not some punk kid with a mohawk.
DIALOG | Cuthbert | Yes, of course. Well, if you need a pet then I, uh, I've got some here but I don't think any of them are a suitable fit for a govenor...

DIALOG | Cuthbert | Well, I can't really afford to keep someone on for too long. But... but I think I've got a job you could do. Do you have any promoting experience? Do you think you could maybe advertise the place, convince people to check us out and get a pet?
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Well, I'm asking for a friend but I think that would be right up his alley.

DIALOG | P_NAME   | I assure you, he's serious. He's extremely serious, actually.
DIALOG | Cuthbert | Well I tell you what, serious or not, this guy needs to learn some professionalism. He can't just phone in an application and expect to get a job just because I'm desperate and going to be destitute if I don't turn the store around! I mean... he can, he totally can. That's my problem. But what a screwed up thing to do! I just want to be a businessman...
DIALOG | P_NAME   | I understand your reservations, he's a strange guy for sure. He definitely cares about pets though. That much I can guarantee.
DIALOG | Cuthbert | Damn... I suppose I'll have to take a chance. I'm not in much of a position to turn down help right now. All right, tell him he's got his job - I want him here as soon as he can get here. There's a lot of work to do!

DIALOG | P_NAME   | N-no, sir! This is Eric's resume! He's kind of a weird guy bu-
DIALOG | Cuthbert | Look, kid. I'm an honest, hard-working guy. I'm not the greatest guy in Tir na Nog but I treat the animals and the people around me with respect. I'm not some crazy fucking animal lunatic, I'm just a tired guy trying to make ends meet in a world I didn't ask for. Is this what kids do these days, kick guys while they're down? Is that what you do? The pet store's not solvent, I'm in debt, people don't even know this place exists. Is that what you do?
DIALOG | P_NAME   | No, mister! I'm not making fun of you, this is Eric's real-
DIALOG | Cuthbert | Just... just go, kid. Just leave me alone.
QUEST  | ericQuest = 6

RESUMEDISLIKE
DIALOG | Cuthbert | I don't know what kind of joke you thought you were pulling by bringing that fake resume down here, but it wasn't funny. I'm not some crazy animal man. Selling animal companions is my business, my life, and it's dangerously close to falling apart. To mock me when my life is this close to disintegrating...
DIALOG | P_NAME   | No, mister, it isn't like that-
DIALOG | Cuthbert | Just get out of here, kid. Just leave me alone.

RESUMENEUTRAL
DIALOG | Cuthbert | I hope this friend of yours is better at working with animals than he is at filling up job applications...

RESUMELIKE
DIALOG | Cuthbert | Maybe my business won't go under after all. This friend of yours might just be the thing I've been looking for.

ERICHIREDNOTHEREYET
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Hey Cuthbert, I let Eric know. I'm sure he'll be here soon. 
DIALOG | Cuthbert | Thanks, kid! Maybe things will turn around here...

HOPELIVES
DIALOG | Cuthbert | Things are slowly turning around. I don't know where you found this friend of yours but he is a clispsend... Well, sort of anyway. I'm hopeful for the future of this pet shop now. Thanks again, kid. I wish I'd have something more to give to you than mere words.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Hey that's alright mister. I'm just glad I could help.
