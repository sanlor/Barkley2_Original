DIALOG | P_NAME       | Hey, don't sweat it. I've got an idea on how to help out Master Miller and this dojo, and I need to borrow your fiery fists for it.
DIALOG | The Hiya Kid | I don't know... It's a secret jutsu that only the people in this dojo are allowed to learn.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I'm not asking you to teach it to me, I'm asking you to use it for the good of the dojo.
DIALOG | The Hiya Kid | O-okay, well... What I used on you was just a simple `kw`Hiya Chop!`rt` It's a jutsu I developed on my own, but it's based on another, much more powerful jutsu that I know called `kw`The Winds of the King.`rt` Basically I concetrate all of my `kw`chi`rt` into my fist and it'll `sq`glow orange.`rt` It's like when you grab onto a flashlight and then close your hand around the light, that sort of a glow. 
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Uh, I'm not that interested in a flashlight.
DIALOG | The Hiya Kid | No no, you don't understand. The glow is merely a prelude. When all of my `kw`chi`rt` is concentrated on my fist, it is considered a `sq`weapon of mass destruction.`rt` With the juiced up fist I could knock a boulder 10 feet into the air, easily.

DIALOG | P_NAME       | Just humour me, please.
DIALOG | The Hiya Kid | O-okay. Uh, if the secret move was used on a dwarf... Hmm, I think the most likely outcome would be that the dwarf in question would be knocked out cold for a long time.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Hmm, sounds good.
DIALOG | The Hiya Kid | Hey, please don't tell anyone about this, okay? I could get into a lot of trouble for spreading around details about the secret jutsu of the dojo.
