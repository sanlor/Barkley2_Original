GOVERNOR
DIALOG | Vivian | You certainly don't see many Duergars at Father Giuseppe's sermons... Perhaps if we had a larger chapel, more people would be interested...

GRANNY_DOWN
DIALOG | P_NAME | (I'm not going to bother her. She's sleeping so heavily, she must have been really tired.)

GRANDKIDS
DIALOG | P_NAME | Vivian, are Cornrow and Juicebox really your grandkids?
DIALOG | Vivian | Yes they are. We are all Clispaeth's children.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah but that really doesn't answer my question. I was asking if they are YOUR grandchildren?
DIALOG | Vivian | Oh yes, you are such a sweet boy for asking.

HOUSE
DIALOG | P_NAME | Don't you live in that house by Morty's Candy Shop?
DIALOG | Vivian | Yes, dear.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Well why does the front door have that tape all over it?
DIALOG | Vivian | Oh, well I don't know about all that. My two little helpers said I should come here because of /'the heat./' I don't remember Tir na nOg getting so warm in these months but with youngsters' Wrist-CONPs and Smart Apps and whatchamajiggers I just listen. Little old me can't stand the heat anymore.

TWOBOYS
DIALOG | P_NAME | You mentioned two helpers?
DIALOG | Vivian | Oh yes, such sweet boys. Wanted me to keep their bballs in my bathtub. Well I wasn't using my tub anymore because I'm old you see? And old people don't sweat.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | B-b-bballs?
DIALOG | Vivian | But I never did see those bball-whatsamahavers in my bathtub. Those two sweet boys came by and said they had a change of plans and that it would best if I got to church. We you don't have to tell me twice to praise the Lord! I skedaddled right on over here.

NARYYEMIND
DIALOG | P_NAME | Nary ye mind, I'll be going Vivian.
DIALOG | Vivian | Clispaeth bless you, little one.

POSTCURFEW
DIALOG | Vivian | Maybe the new Duergar Governor isn't as bad as we had initially thought. Perhaps he is a blessing from Clispaeth after all, or perhaps what they say is true - that Cuchulainn really was one of Clispaeth's Disciples...
GOTO   | VIVIANQUESTIONS

CLISP_FACT02
DIALOG | Vivian | Youngster, I can tell you have a deep faith in Clispaeth and I admire that. But I can tell you're also going through deep inner turmoil, that you're losing your identity and questioning that faith. Sometimes the best thing to do is to close your eyes and relax for a little bit. Try a new fruit. Try some grapes. If you don't like grapes, try raisins.

GOTO   | VIVIANQUESTIONS

CLISP_FACT01
DIALOG | Vivian | Some people say Cuchulainn knew Clispaeth, that he might have even been one of his Disciples! How could Cuchulainn have fallen so far from Clispaeth's teachings? What made Cuchulainn change so much? Is this what Clispaeth would have wanted? Is all this part of Clispaeth's plan?
QUEST  | clispFact = 1
GOTO   | VIVIANQUESTIONS

VIVIAN2
IF vivianState &lt;= 1 | DIALOG | Vivian | Clispaeth was the prophet of the Cyberpocalypse. He and his apostles brought salvation to everyone, even those nasty Duergars. These days, all dwarfs seem to care about are gems and fruits and Cuchulainn's Prize. I love gems and fruits too, but I would never place them before Clispaeth...
IF vivianState == 2 | DIALOG | Vivian | Oh hello again sweet boy.
QUEST | vivianState = 2
GOTO  | VIVIANQUESTIONS

VIVIAN1
IF vivianState == 0 | DIALOG | Vivian | Oh, Father Giuseppe is such a kind man. His sermons about Clispaeth are the only things that give me hope sometimes. I'm... I'm starting to wonder what F.A.T.E. Cuchulainn has in store for the dwarfs... every day there's more and more of us here and things are getting worse and worse. But... but as long as I keep my faith in Clispaeth, I'll remain strong.
