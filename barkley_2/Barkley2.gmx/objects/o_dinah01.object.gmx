DIALOG | P_NAME | Whoa, that's a neat machine you've got there. Are you a DJ or something?
DIALOG | Dinah  | Hey, what's up? I guess I'm an aspiring DJ... I'm just getting started to be honest. It's just a drum machine, nothing that special.

DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah, I did meet her... she didn't have a lot of good things to say about you. Maybe that's more a reflection on her than you though.
DIALOG | Dinah  | Haha, thanks. You into booty bass at all? That's kinda what I want to do. I'm getting pretty good at programming these drums, I'm trying to find a group to play with but I kinda think Poly's been spreading rumors about me... but anyway, things are looking up! I'm getting better with these drums and someday soon I'll be making my own booty bass!

DIALOG | Dinah  | Mostly that real drummers use real drums, that I'm a hack, that kinda stuff... it really hurts my feelings, we used to be best friends... /'besties/' even. 
DIALOG | Dinah  | Whatever. I'm getting pretty good at programming these drums and I'm trying to find a group to play with but I kinda think Poly's been spreading rumors about me... but I'm getting better and pretty soon I'm gonna be doing my own booty bass stuff!

DIALOG | P_NAME | Very cool, it's at the chapel in Brain City. We're all meeting at the booty bass club. I'm still putting the band together so I might be a little while, but I'll try to be there as soon as I can.
DIALOG | Dinah  | Awesome! I'm kinda nervous... it's gonna be my first gig... but I'll do my best!
