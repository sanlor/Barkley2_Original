GOTO   | MASEGO_REPORT

ARREST_CHUP
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Well, he put up a chase but I managed to get him. Selling chups in The Social: 25 years. Resisting arrest: 10 years. We won't be seeing Clive for a long time. Good catch, kid. You got anything else for me?

ARREST_MORIARTY
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Well, that slimy cretin's rotting in a jail cell as we speak. You were on the money with that one, that guy was nuts. He had this crazy look in his eyes, almost like he wanted to eat me. There's no doubt in my mind that he was responsible for the string of disappearances lately.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | How many people disappeared? Are you sure they're all related to this guy?
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | It's been a problem for a while now but people come and go. Figbottom was a regular, though. He wouldn't leave The Social without telling us. Justice is served in my books. Good work kid.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Are you sure? I mean, I think it was probably him, but doesn't he deserve a trial or something?
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Hey, so about that bloody glove? I confiscated it as evidence but it won't do anyone any good if it's just sitting around a vault. Do you want to keep it as a souvenir or something? I don't want it.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Ummm, not really... but I guess I'll take it...
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | No problem, kid. Good to work with you. You know, it's people like you with a zeal for justice that give me hope that maybe things will be okay. Take care of yourself out there.

ARREST_KUNIGUNDE        
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | That scumbag Kunigunde's rotting in a hoosegow cell as we speak. I never trusted her anyway, always poking her nose in everyone's business and yapping about things she didn't know about. Whether or not she did it, the town's better off without her. Justice is served in my books.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Glad I could help... but you seemed a little eager to arrest her though... shouldn't she at least have gotten a trial? Did you lock her up as an excuse to get rid of her?
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Hey, so about that tontine money. I confiscated it as evidence but it won't do anyone any good if it's just sitting around a vault. What do you say we split it 50/50? That'd make your cut @money_tontineCut@ neuro-shekels.

Well Suresh didn't get away with it this time and he won't be getting away with it again.

DIALOG | Marshal Masego | I thought I made myself completely clear when I told you I didn't want to see you around anymore. You're exactly the kind of person who ticks me off; someone who doesn't give a rat dip about anyone but yourself. Get the hell out of the Industrial Park and don't come back.

DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Hey, so about that jerkin they found? I confiscated it as evidence but I'm never going to use it. Why don't you take it?

DIALOG | Marshal Masego | No problem, kid. Good to work with you. You know, it's people like you with a zeal for justice that give me hope that maybe things will be okay. Take care of yourself out there.

DIALOG | P_NAME         | Is there anything I can do to help out? You seem kind of busy.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Have you given any thought about helping me find out what happened to Figbottom? He's that junk collector who disappeared. That's what I need the most help with right now, think you've got the time?

DIALOG | Marshal Masego | As a matter of fact, yeah, you can. There was this guy who used to hang around here, Figbottom, who's gone missing. He and his buddy Suresh would scavenge for scraps at the Junk Yard south of here, so it's not unusual that he'd disappear for a while, but never this long. I don't know what's up, but there have been a handful of other disappearances lately and I'm worried that they all might be connected.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | What do you want me to do? Find him?
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Yeah, if it's still possible. It may be too late to find him and if you can't, I want you to find out if there was foul play, if anyone did something to him. Is this something you think you've got the time for?       
                
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Yeah, I think I can help you out. Where should I start?
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Ah, that's a load off my shoulders. I appreciate it. What I'd do is talk to his friend Suresh to see if he knows anything and go from there. Figbottom and Suresh were best friends who scavenged everywhere together so he should know something.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Okay, I think I've got it. I may not be the best gumshoe in the world, but I'll give it my all.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Don't gum it up too much, youngster. And most importantly, I want a perp. Remember that everyone is a suspect and nobody's above suspicion. If you think you know what happened to Figbottom or who was involved in his disappearance, you tell me. Got it?
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Yeah, got it.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Good, then get out of here.
QUEST  | figbottomQuest = 3
             
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Sounds like you've got your hands full. Wish I could help, but I just don't have the time.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Yeah, it's a big, messy job. I wouldn't want to do it if I were in your shoes. Let me know if you change your mind, I can use the help.
QUEST  | figbottomQuest = 1

DIALOG | P_NAME | Is there anything I can do to help out? You seem kind of busy.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | If you'd have asked a while ago, you could've helped me out with a disappearance of one of the local junk collectors, but it's been too long and the case is cold. Too bad, justice would've been nice.

ASK_FIGBOTTOM
DIALOG | P_NAME         | What happened to Figbottom?
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Well, Figbottom disappeared a few weeks ago. This wouldn't be a big problem but I don't want it to become a precedent. More than that, I'm pretty sure whoever did him in (and I know there was foul play) is still in town. Since you're looking for the culprit, what I'd do is talk to his closest friend, Suresh. The two were inseparable, so I'd start with him.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Okay, will do.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Anything else?
GOTO   | QUESTION_SPECIFIC
                
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | To be honest, Figbottom was kind of a chump and nobody's too upset that he's gone. In fact, as far as I can see, a handful of people are pleased that he's gone and I'd be one of them if it didn't make my life more difficult. At this point I don't think there's much of a chance that I'll be finding him, but I might still be able to find out who did him in and put them to justice. See, that's what it's my job to care about: justice.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Figbottom was a junk collector who disappeared a couple weeks ago. It's been too long since we've lost him and the case is cold. I suspect foul play, but at this point I don't think we'll ever know what happened. Too bad. Anything else?

ASK_IRMINGARD
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Who is Sister Irmingard?
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | She's a Klispin preacher. I guess she got it into her head that the Cybergremlins outside of town should be Klispins too. Who knows, maybe if they convert they'll stop causing so much trouble. Worth a shot, I guess. Anything else?

ASK_SEPIDEH
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Who's Sepideh and what is she building?
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | She's the town mechanic. She built our turrets, our water pumps and pretty much everything else in the Industrial Park. I have no idea what she's building but she's never done us wrong so let her build whatever she wants. Anything else?
GOTO   | QUESTION_SPECIFIC
            
ASK_CUCHU
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Cuchulainn is a problem out here?
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | You think that because we're not in Tir na Nog, Cuchulainn isn't a problem? No. Out here, Cuchulainn is ten times the problem he was in Tir na Nog. The Duergars and Bainshees are the reason we've got that turret system set up. Cuchulainn's minions are the reason I have a perpetual headache, not to mention a job, so yes, he's a problem out here. Anything else?
