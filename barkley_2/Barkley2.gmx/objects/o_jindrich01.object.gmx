GOVERNOR
DIALOG   | Jindrich            | Hey Mr. Governor, just throwing it out there, but what do you think about subsidizing the cost of fruit?
DIALOG   | Governor Elagabalus | Good advice. Great advice! Thanks for doing your civic duty and telling me that thing about fruit. I will certainly think about it, because I am the Governor, and it's my job to think about things.

DIALOG   | P_NAME   | Hey, what's up?
DIALOG   | Jindrich | Psst... it's a little weird seeing Gelasio here. They shipped him and his buddy Augustine off to the mines for awhile, and I've never seen a dwarf come back from there. He's also been spending lots of neuro-shekels_ and getting really generous with the fruit juice if you know what I mean. I wonder what his angle is?
DIALOG   | P_NAME   | Interesting...
DIALOG   | Jindrich | Not to mention, Augie's been missing for a day or so... I wonder if Gelasio knows more than what he's letting on.
CHOICE   | About that Gelasio...
REPLY    | TRUST    | Maybe he was just being friendly?
REPLY    | UNTRUST  | I smell a rat.

JINDRICHAPRICOT03
