DIALOG | P_NAME  | You mean egg-?
DIALOG | Sepideh | I mean what I mean..._ Look, it's not the `kw`Ovum`rt` that's important, it's the `kw`Influence`rt` that's held within it. And this one needs to be `sq`recharged`rt` as soon as possible.
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Recharged, huh?
DIALOG | Sepideh | Yes, recharged. I found this Influence Ovum in a pile of rubble near the `kw`Power Plant.`rt` But that's beside the point. What we need is a `kw`Dynamoeuf`rt` to draw power into the `kw`Ovum.`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | Dyna-?
DIALOG | Sepideh | -mouef. Look,_ I don't know how they work or even what they really are, but I know the whole ship runs on them, and I know that there are at least three of them in that `sq`Power Plant`rt` just `kw`northeast from here.`rt`

DIALOG | P_NAME  | Is there anything I can do?
DIALOG | Sepideh | Yes, actually. I was just coming to that part. You see, there was some malfunction or whatever at the `kw`Power Plant`rt` and ever since then it's been infested by these... monsters. 
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Monsters?
DIALOG | Sepideh | Yeah, big gnarly beasts aching to rip dwarfs apart. I'm just a simple engineer, I wouldn't stand a chance in there. But you... You look like you can handle some danger. You would be able to make it in there and refill this `kw`Ovum`rt`. What do you say?

ITEM   | Influence Ovum | -1
DIALOG | Sepideh | Wow, thanks! You don't know how much this means to me.
DIALOG | P_NAME  | What exactly are you going to do with it?
DIALOG | Sepideh | I'm going to use it as a new power source for the turrets that are outside this town. Oh, actually, would you mind doing one more thing for me? 
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Uh, sure. What do you need?
DIALOG | Sepideh | Okay, so, after I hook up this Influence Ovum I'll need to be reboot the system. I need someone to go outside the walls to make sure everything is working as intended.
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Just check out the turrets? Hey, wait a minute. Isn't that super dangerous?
DIALOG | Sepideh | Umm, no. Well, I mean, I don't think so. I'll change the targeting parameters to duergars. That way you shouldn't be registered as a threat.
DIALOG | P_NAME  | You don't sound too confident that this'll even work.
DIALOG | Sepideh | Well...
WAIT   | 0.75
DIALOG | Sepideh | Look, if these turrets aren't up and running as inteded by the end of the day, then I'll be in a lot of trouble. Like, in a LOT of trouble. Come on, just do this one little thing for me, alright? 
DIALOG | P_NAME  | `w1`*Sigh*`w0` So all I have to do is make sure the turrets are powered up?
DIALOG | Sepideh | Yeah, that's right! Real simple. Hey man, thanks for doing this. Means a lot to me. Alright, good luck out there.
