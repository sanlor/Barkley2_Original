GOVERNOR_WAS_CAPTURED
DIALOG | Cruce | Hey dude. Have you heard the news? The duergs `kw`locked down Tir na nog for good.`rt` They aren't letting anyone in anymore. 
DIALOG | Cruce | Apparently what happened was that the rebels were able to capture and imprison `kw`Governor Elagabalus`rt` and used him for their evil plans. Crazy, huh?
DIALOG | Cruce | Anyway, the rumour has it that the governor was able to escape from his captivity and then began a campaign of terror and torment on the dwarfs of Tir na nog.
DIALOG | Cruce | There's no way in, and the only way out is in a casket, it seems.

TNN_PRISON_LOCKDOWN
DIALOG | Cruce | Hey dude. Have you heard the news? Apparently the newly appointed governor, Governor Elagabalus, has brought an age of unprecedented tyranny and torture to tir na nog.
DIALOG | Cruce | One of his first policies he enacted was putting tir na nog into a permanent lockdown. There's no way in, and no way out. 
DIALOG | Cruce | I don't even want to imagine what the duergs are doing to those poor dwarfs in there. It's crazy... How could this have happened?
