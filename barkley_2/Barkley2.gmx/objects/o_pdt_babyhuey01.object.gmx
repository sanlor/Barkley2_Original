DIALOG | P_NAME       | I don't know. Do you think you're disgusting?
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Yeah right, I'm on top of the world. You can't be on top of the world if you're disgusting. It's just not possible.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Well that's good.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Got a `w1`dick caught in my feather`w0` though, I got the fire and it's burning.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | These words have no meaning to me.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | I got a problem on account of my not getting around so great anymore. Gotta have your hand to help me with it, you know.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Yeah?
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Yeah. You see, got these guys on the line that say they want to give me money for my `kw`/'organs/'.`rt` Got quite the `w1`dilemma.`w0`
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I talked to those guys. It sounds kinda shady.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Yeah, there's got to be some catch. Nobody is `w1`stupid enough`w0` to pay for organs.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Huh?
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | What do you mean HUH??? Don't tell me you're one of those stupid idiots that's been conned by medical /'science/'?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I don't know what you're talking about.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | It's all just a marketing scheme. The doctors will tell you `kw`OH NO YOUR TOOTH IS INJURED, LET'S REPLACE TOOTH.`rT` What do you think is really wrong with the tooth?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | It could be broken. It's easy to break a tooth I think.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Oh really. `w1`OH REALLY.`w0` Ok Mr. Science, tell me the science behind breaking a tooth.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I don't know, they just break.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Then explain `kw`why ducks don't have teeth,`rt` smart guy.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I don't know. I guess you don't need them.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Typical liberal response. So I need to get moving on this, pronto. These know-nothing clowns called up and said they'd pay me for my organs, appparently they never read `sq`Fitzner and Bokanovsky's`rt` book, `kw`/'The organ myth/',`rt` or they'd know that organs don't do anything.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I don't think this book is accurate. I think organs do stuff. Like the brain does stuff I think.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Well we've already established that you know `w1`LESS THAN NOTHING`w0` about medicine so I will be inclined to believe the opposite of what you say.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | But what if you started giving them organs you needed? Some are important I think. I think you'd stop being you if you gave someone your brain.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Rubbish, I did not get to international superstardom to tolerate such rubbish. Here, answer me this: What do you do with your toe nails? What do you do with your hair after a haircut? What do you do with your defecation or spittle?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Just....put it wherever. It's garbage.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Oh??? `s1`Garbage, huh?`s0` This valued piece of you is somehow arbitrarily no longer you? When does something `s1`STOP`s0` being you and start being garbage?
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I don't know. When it falls out or you eject it or something?
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | You truly are one of the -LAMBS- that Fitzner and Bokanovsky are always warning me about. It's clear we cannot have an intelligent conversation, so let me get right to the point: If these organs are so VALUABLE in your mystical world, why not just take my organs? I'm literally giving them to you to sell for me, all I require is my cut, you take care of the leg work.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I still think you're making a mistake but I'll do you a favor if you think you somehow can live without your organs.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Yes, just keep going on insulting my belief system. Just remember that when you insult me you do not merely insult me, you insult Fitzner and Bokanovsky.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | I'm sorry. This is just a new way of thinking for me, I guess.
DIALOG | Babby Hubert | I guess it is to be expected from such a lowly `kw`-LAMB-.`rt` I shouldn't be forced to domesticate someone like you, but I will if I must..... Now! Are you ready? Let's get this party started. It's time to get rid of this dead weight. A more perfect me, right around the corner.

DIALOG | Babby Hubert | Take this branch trimmer. Hold it with your hands. You've got thumbs, right?
