DIALOG | P_NAME | That sounds violent...
DIALOG | Turald | So are the Fiscians. No one really knows why they took to such hatred against us Dwarfs, but I think it's the xenophobic rhetoric of their duly elected leader: Bass Mother.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Gulp... Bass Mother?
DIALOG | Turald | Never seen her myself but she's a prize to be hooked that's for sure. A terrifying beast that patrols only the most polluted waters.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Sounds dangerous.

My hardened muscles on one end of the line,_ the thrashing stock of a gun'sfish on the other. Something about it seems more pure to the sport than plucking a disgusting Fiscian from the water.
