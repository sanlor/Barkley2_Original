"I am Gillian Bonko. I'm 16 years old student from Tir na Nog. My hobbies include playing vidcons, drawing, listening to music and having a good ol' time. I have a dad and a mom and a pet dog, Quatroxinian. So in many ways I'm like all my friends, just a normal kid.##
At least... that is what I thought before all this happened. It all began during the summer. School was over and it was a time for our summer break. My parents were about to leave to go to a dance party for the night so me and Quatroxinian would have the house all for ourselves. The only thing between us and a rad vidcon marathon was my dad's request to mow the lawn.##
At first I was frustrated but then I thought to myself that the faster I get to it, the more time for vidcons I wil have. So I went and got our lawnmower, a Gilgian Cutmaster 3000. An old model but it gets the job done.##
I pulled on the ignition cord 3 times before I realized that I had not fueled it. I ran to the barn to get the fuel canister and back to the lawnmower again in 21.5 seconds. I opened the fuel tank and the canister and carefully started to pour the fuel in. But something was off. The fuel... it was red, like blood. I knew it wasn't blood because it smelled like fuel, so I thought it was just the reflection form the sun playing tricks on me.##
I fueled the lawnmower in 12.9 seconds and then sealed both the tank and the canister in a few moments. I tried to start the engine again. First pull didn't work. Second pull didn't work. I decided to pull harder. On the third pull, I grabbed the wire and clenched my fist together until sweat started pouring from my hands. Then I pulled as hard as I could and sure enough the lawnmower started but not the way I wanted. The inigtion sound was 3.2 times as loud as normal. It was a deafening roar that sent me flying to the lawn in shock.##
I calmed myself and got up in 6.12 seconds. The lawnmower was now on, and I proceeded to mow the lawn. All the while I was doing that I could hear a faint clicking sound from the lawnmower. It was faint, especially with the sound of the engine roaring on top of it, but it was there. At first I didn't think anything of it but after a while I got worried that maybe the lawnmower was going to break or something if I kept on mowing without looking at what was causing the sound so I stopped the engine and to my surprise the clicking sound could still be heard.##
I got down on my knees and placed me head closer to the engine so I could make some sense off what was making that sound. The delay between the clicks was 3.24 seconds every time and the clicks came in a series of 5 clicks and then a 9.43 second pause. For a moment I thought to myself that maybe it was the lawnmowers heartbeat but that was impossible. Machines don't have hearts. There was no way I could find out what the sound was like this, I had to take a look inside since that is where the sound came from.##
In order to see inside the machine I turned the lawnmower upside down to see if that was where the sound was coming from. The lawnmower was heavy and after I had managed to turn it upside down for 95.8 degrees I lost my grip and it fell on top of me and hurt my knee. My knee was gushing blood so I went back inside to put a bandage on it. When I came back I noticed somthing terrifying. A large pool of blood where the lawnmower was lying. Was this my blood? No, it couldn't have been. There was at least 7.43 liters of it. 7.43 liters? That's exactly how much I fueled the lawnmower for!##
What was going on? I went over to the lawnmower and turned it upside down proper like I had meant to do previously. Now I could see the blades and the bottom of the engine and some covers that protect it. The clicking sound was going on slower now... the delay between the clicks was now 5.66 seconds. I looked closer to see where the sound was coming from. That's when I heard a voice from inside the lawnmower. It said " + '"' + "Help me..." + '"' + " What the hell?! What was going on!? Was the lawnmower haunted? I leaned forward and said " + '"' + "Are you talking?" + '"' + " For the longest time there was no response...##
Then all of the sudden it talked back, in a pained, slow voice. " + '"' + "Please... Help me... I need fuel, it's my blood. Without fuel... I will die... Please, reach in and stop the leak..." + '"' + " Despite the situation being strange, I could notice that he was talking the truth, there was a leak on one of its fuel hoses behind the blades. I didn't know how it could talk or if it really was sentient or if I was going crazy. But it didn't matter. It was my Clispian duty to help those in need. I reached inside the lawnmower for 7.43 seconds until I could reach the leak. I placed my finger on top of it.##
The lawnmower spoke again, this time in a more relieved voice. " + '"' + "Ahh... thank you youngster... for giving me my fuel, my blood... and thank you... for giving me YOURS!" + '"' + " I freaked out but it was too late. The infernal machine tied up my hands inside itself in 1.4 seconds using all the wires and pipes inside it. I was stuck with my hands inside the lawnmower. The lawnmower let out a diabolical laughter. I yelled at it to let me go. But it didn't listen. It squirted its fuel in my eyes and I couldn't see anymore. I couldn't see and I couldn't use my hands to wipe my eyes clean. I was horrified. My heart raced like it never has before.##
Then the lawnmower laughed once more and tightened its grip on my hands. No matter how many times I yelled (6 times) it didn't help. The lawnmower started itself up and cut off my arms. My eyes had fuel so I couldn't see anything but I felt my hands being cut off. I fell to the ground feeling weaker and weaker. I couldn't see, my arms were cut off, and I was dying... It was...###
