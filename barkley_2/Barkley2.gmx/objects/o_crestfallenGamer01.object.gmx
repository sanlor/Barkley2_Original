CRESTFALL_0
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | Well, well, well... Who do we have here? A new gamer? Let me guess: a youngster on his path to a gamer's destiny? Right? You're not the first one to try to grasp that glorious destiny...

DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | Heh!
QUEST  | crestfallenGamer = 1

CRESTFALL_1
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | Long, long ago, the world had nothing in it but the `sq`archdrakes`rt` and the `sq`archtrees.`rt` Nothing else existed. Just a great gray lump of dirt, with archdrakes and archtrees. That's all there was. Absolutely nothing else existed... Then the knights killed all the drakes.
SOUND  | sn_heh01
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | Heh!
QUEST  | crestfallenGamer = 2

CRESTFALL_2
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | The fire is fading... Soon it will go out entirely, and the era of dankess begins. I mean, the fire is fine right now. But eventually it'll go out... Good thing we have the flint technology.
SOUND  | sn_heh01
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | Heh!
QUEST  | crestfallenGamer = 3

CRESTFALL_3
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | Have you ever heard of the `sq`Dank Gamer?`rt` Legend has it that long ago, during the age of the `sq`archdrakes`rt` and the `sq`archtrees,`rt` AKA the `sq`Arch-Age,`rt` gamers were not united. They also didn't exist because only archdrakes and archtrees existed. Then the knights killed them all and created `mq`The Gamers...`rt` 
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | `sq`The Fire Gamer...`rt` 
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | `sq`Ice Gamer...`rt` 
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | `sq`Lightning Gamer...`rt` 
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | `sq`Earth Gamer...`rt` 
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | `sq`Water Gamer...`rt` 
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | ...and last but not least, the `mq`Dank Gamer.`rt`
SOUND  | sn_heh01
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | Heh!
QUEST  | crestfallenGamer = 4

CRESTFALL_4
DIALOG | Crestfallen Gamer | When the fire fades the dankness will come again. Great horrors await in the dank. Or actually great prosperity. One or the other. But actually the fire isn't really fading, or maybe it is. The winds of destiny are blazing in the fires of F.A.T.E. The age of dankess will fade and the fire is reborn, except that it really isn't, and then there will be an endless dankess or an endless fire, but then the fire fades and... `sq`The Curse of the Dank Gamer`rt` will be upon us, but not really.
