KNOW   | knowDwarfs | 1
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | First it was just Fritz Katzenjammer, but now his brother Hans has gone missing too! It's crazy, but that's not even all there is to it. Apparently the Eight Little Dwarfs have gone missing too. What is going on in here?
GOTO   | QUESTION_CHOICE

SCOOP_BIOTEK
DIALOG | P_NAME         | What is this Big Bad Wolf &amp; Benjamin Biotek place?
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Oh you mean that `kw`laboratory a few floors above us?`rt` I have to be honest and say that I know diddly squat about that place besides that the folks over there are these mysterious science types. 
GOTO   | QUESTION_CHOICE

SCOOP_CDWARF
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Do you know anything about The Cyberdwarf?
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | The Cyberdwarf? Yes, I think I've heard that name before... He's supposed to be some ancient and wise person, right? Hmm, the only one who'd fit a description like that would be `kw`Dr. Benjamin.`rt` Perhaps Cyberdwarf is a nom de guerre of Dr. Benjamin?
KNOW   | knowBenhur     | 1
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Uh, doesn't sound right but I guess it's worth investigating. Where can I find this Dr. Benjamin?
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | He is one of the top dogs at `kw`Big Bad Wolf &amp; Benjamin Biotek,`rt` just a few levels up from here. I wouldn't have high hopes about meeting him though. That place is a `kw`high security laboratory,`rt` among other things. You can't just waltz your way in there.
KNOW   | knowBiotek     | 1
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Oh, okay...
GOTO   | QUESTION_CHOICE

SCOOP_SMROCK
DIALOG | P_NAME         | What is Smoking Rock?
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Smoking Rock? Nothing you should concern yourself with. It's an alcoholic beverage, hot off the presses! That's all we are serving today here at the Prancing Brony. It's a funny story actually. You see the brewery who makes this stuff, Wolf Bean &amp; Brew LLC, approached me and told me I could have several barrels of the stuff for free if I agreed to take every other item off the menu for one day.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Huh? That sounds pretty strange. There's gotta be a catch, right?
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | No, no catch. I mean there really isn't much risk since it's for one day only, and it's also selling like hot cakes. I'm going to make a small fortune with this stuff.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Hey, that's good. Oh, actually, I had some other questions I wanted to ask.
GOTO   | QUESTION_CHOICE

SCOOP_UNHOLY
DIALOG | P_NAME         | What's this Unholy Alliance that I've heard about?
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Hmmm...
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Huh? That sounds pretty strange. There's gotta be a catch, right?
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | No, no catch. I mean there really isn't much risk since it's for one day only, and it's also selling like hot cakes. I'm going to make a small fortune with this stuff.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Hey, that's good. Oh, actually, I had some other questions I wanted to ask.
GOTO   | QUESTION_CHOICE

NPC_YK
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about the Yellow Kid.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | The Yellow Kid? What about him? He is a loudmouth punk always bothering my customers for free drinks. A lousy character, that's for sure, and certainly not the sharpest tool in the shed. He is what some would call a low information voter.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_KATZEN
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about the Katzenjammers
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Ah, the Katzenjammers. Hans and Fritz, the entrepreneurs. They run a startup mining company down here in Ys-Kolob called the Katzen Kompany. You might have walked past a great pit before you wandered in here, yes? Well, that's them down there, in their precious grotto.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_OLIVER
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about Oliver Twist and Fantomas
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Uh, I don't think you should go anywhere near those two. Just trust me on this one, youngster.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Huh? Why not?
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | They're bad news, pal. Those two crooks wouldn't hesitate for two seconds to exploit a youngster like you for their illegal activities. Sure, they might seem trustworthy on the outside but... Trust me kid, you don't want anything to do with them.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_ITALY
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about Geppetto.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Ah, the italiano. Yes, I know him well. He's been coming here for years and I've never had any trouble from him. He is a true family man. But... Well, I don't want to go to details but ever since some shady stuff went down with him he hasn't been the same. 
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_QUASI
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about Quasimodo.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Quasimodo... That old goofball is always up to something. Haven't seen him much ever since he stopped drinking and took up smoking instead. It helps him to stay awake, or so he says. Maybe he should've done that before the `kw`graverobbers`rt` ransacked his graveyard, heh.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_POCA
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about Pocahontas.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | The people here refer to her as `kw`/'The Ranger/'`rt` because she likes to go off into the wild for months at a time on her own. I really don't know much about her. I've heard some rumours that she's got herself tangled up in some crime syndicate dealings.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_ROBIN
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about the Robinsons.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | You mean the swiss family Robinson? I honestly don't know anything at all about them, they only started appearing in Ys-Kolob today. Looking forward to learning more about them.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_LION
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about the Cowardly Lion.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Ah... It's a tragic tale, really. He used to be among the top brass of the military but then his entire platoon got ganked in a heavily pasta-based attack and he hasn't been the same since. I think he still blames himself for what happened...
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_DIEGO
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about Don Diego de la Vega.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Don Diego de la Vega? There's really not much to say about him. Runs a gift shop next to the graveyard and never really seems to do anything else. Don't tell anyone I said this but I think Don Diego de la Vega is a very boring individual, living a very normal, boring life.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_ZORRO
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about El Zorro.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Wow! El Zorro? I could go on for hours about his many adventures! He is the cold blade that stabs you in the night! He is the swift shadow that twirls on the wall! He is the majestic mystery that we all wish we were ourselves. He is known to dualwield two pistols called Lebanon and Hillary.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_NICK
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about Nick Carter.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | A detective of some sort. He's been coming here for a drink every now and then and always asks about the goings-on of Ys-Kolob. A very serious guy, keeps to himself.  
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_PAUL
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about Paulin Birquet.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | A detective of some sort. Must be one of Nick Carter's collaques since they both appeared here at the same time. I've rarely seen him around the town. This is just a hunch but I think him and Nick Carter might be doing some sort of an investigations. About what, that I do not know.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_BEN
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about Dr. Benjamin.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Ah, the head scientist at Big Bad Wolf &amp; Benjamin Biotek. He co-founded the company with Big Bad Wolf years and years ago. That's also about how long it has been since I've last seen him anywhere. They must be really dedicated to whatever it is they are doing up there.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_BABBY
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about Babby Hubert.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | Ugh... I think I'm going to be sick...
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_QUIXO
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about yourself.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | You want to know more about me? Uh, okay, let's see now... Jeez, I don't know what to say, honestly. Sorry.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_ZIGO
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Tell me about Zigomar.
DIALOG | Donald Quixote | A shady character for sure. Totally untrustworthy in my books. If you are going have dealings with Zigomar then be careful.
GOTO   | SCOOP_NPCS

NPC_NARY
DIALOG | P_NAME         | Actually I wanted to ask about something else.
GOTO   | QUESTION_CHOICE

SCOOP_NARY
