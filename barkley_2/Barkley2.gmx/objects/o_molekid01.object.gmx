wstl_NPC_4 - Nada
**********

// Even though it's really far outside of the common genetic profile of moles, Nada needs to have large, fairly prominent eyes. The semi-scientific logic I'm going with here is that moles have eyes, but they never really develop, probably in part because they have no need for them in their existence, causing them to just stay undeveloped. A mole person living their life in a plastic bubble, however, would have a need for the development of their eyes, so I'm rolling with the logic that a mole growing up in these circumstances would develop reasonably keen use of their eyes, out of pure necessity. This is also imperative for three reasons: it'd be completely illogical for a blind lifeform to want to spend their last day going to a scenic view, it works with the theme that a large-eyed mole would look grotesque/undesirable to potential mole people thinking about adopting, and that characters with prominent, innocent looking eyes are really sympathetic.

// The nada secion is broken up into several smaller dialogues. The playthrough works where every time the player stops to fight, Nada will dig a little hole into the ground and wait for the player to clear out the monsters. When they do, Nada comes out of the hole and talks briefly with the player. Part of the design of this is that Nada is pretty excited and talkative, to the point of being slightly annoying, giving the player room to generally blow her off when she asks questions, or just outright dump her in the middle of the junkyard. Basically, it's the player's option to even bother humoring her when she asks questions about what's going on, so most of the dialogue is reasonably optional

// One of the things of note here is that there's tons of room for the smalltalk between the player and Nada to go in different directions depending on factors in the player build. I still don't have the information to begin doing that in earnest, but I'm marking places where that feels appropriate so I can make alternative dialogue when I have the right information.

DIALOG | Nada   | Hey! Hey, mister!!
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...huh?
DIALOG | Nada   | Oh, great! You stopped to talk to me! Thank you! 
DIALOG | Nada   | Mister, I really need to get to the mountain overlook. I need to meet my dad there, but it's too dangerous for me to go by myself. I tried to sneak my way there but I was almost eaten by a Brak-Nur.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't know. It's pretty dangerous out there. I don't know if I could keep you safe. You might want to try finding someone stronger.
DIALOG | Nada   | Please!! I really need to get there soon! 
DIALOG | Nada   | My dad is really rich! He's a railroad tycoon! He owns pretty much all the railroads on Necron 7!! He's a really important guy!! 
DIALOG | Nada   | My dad really loves me a lot, and he'd be really grateful if you could take me to him. I know he'd give you a huge reward if you took me there. I bet he's worried sick about me right now...

MISSION_CHOICE
CHOICE | Take Nada to the mountain overlook?
REPLY  | SURE   | Sure. I can take you.
REPLY  | NOPE   | It's too dangerous.

SURE
DIALOG | P_NAME | Sure, I can take you. It's not going to be an easy trip, but I'm pretty handy with a gun.(place for condition text)
DIALOG | Nada   | Yes!!! Great!!! Thank you so much!!! This is going to be the best.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I still don't really know what we should do if monsters attack us, though. Do you want to ride on my shoulders? That would slow me down a little bit, but I think it would keep the monsters from attacking you.
DIALOG | Nada   | That's really nice of you to offer, but I'm a mole! I can just dig into the ground when monsters attack!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Wow. You can do that?
DIALOG | Nada   | Well...yeah, sure I can!
DIALOG | P_NAME | That's so cool.
DIALOG | Nada   | It's just digging. And I'm just a kid so I'm not very good at it. I don't think it's so special.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Well I think it's really cool. It's like a super power. There are places you get to go that I'll never get to go.
DIALOG | Nada   | I don't know. Maybe...
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hey, you shouldn't be so hard on yourself like that. Digging is rough work. You're a tough guy in my book.
DIALOG | Nada   | But I'm a girl! How can I be a tough guy if I'm a girl?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Oh...I don't know. I think everybody can be a tough guy. I think it's just a word.
DIALOG | Nada   | Are you a tough guy, X114JAM9?
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't know. I hope so.
DIALOG | Nada   | Well I think you're a tough guy. Anybody brave enough to go out and fight monsters is definitely a tough guy in my book!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hey, thanks. Well, let's get going. Don't want to keep your dad waiting.
QUEST  | molekidState = 2

NOPE
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'd feel wrong putting you in danger like that. The monsters around here are really strong. I have enough trouble taking care of myself.
DIALOG | Nada   | Oh.... 
DIALOG | Nada   | Well, do you know anybody else who can take me?? It's really important!!
DIALOG | P_NAME | I just don't know. I'm really sorry.
DIALOG | Nada   | Ok...well...if you change your mind, or find someone who can take me, please let me know!
DIALOG | Nada   | I'll stay around here as long as I can... Maybe someone else will come by...
QUEST  | molekidState = 1

MOLEKID_1
DIALOG | Nada   | Hello Mister!! Do you think you can take me to the mountain overlook now?!? My dad can pay you when we get there!! I bet he really misses me a lot right now!! He probably misses me almost as much as I miss him, and that's a lot!
GOTO   | MISSION_CHOICE

FIRST_STOP
DIALOG | Nada   | Hi! Why have we stopped? Are you tired?
CHOICE | Why have we stopped?
REPLY  | TAKE_BREAK | Yeah, just taking five.
REPLY  | NOPE_BREAK | I don't think I can keep leading you around.

NOPE_BREAK
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't think I can keep leading you around. This is just too much for me to handle. You should hurry up and get back to town. Maybe I can take you some other time.
DIALOG | Nada   | No... 
DIALOG | Nada   | My only chance and I... 
DIALOG | Nada   | I blew it.
DIALOG | Nada   | I'm sorry I wasted so much of your time X114JAM9. It's really nice of you to take me this far. This is the nicest thing anybody has ever done for me. Thank you...
DIALOG | Nada   | Good...goodbye...
QUEST  | molekidState = 3

TAKE_BREAK
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah, just taking five. We can go in a minute.
DIALOG | Nada   | Great! Lead the way!

IT_WORKED
DIALOG | P_NAME | I can't believe how well that worked. Are you ok?
DIALOG | Nada   | I don't know. This is really scary. 
DIALOG | Nada   | We aren't going to make it there alive, are we?
CHOICE | Your reply:
REPLY  | NOT_IF    | Not if we stand around talking about it.
REPLY  | TAKE_MORE | It'll take more than a couple wimpy monsters to stop us!

NOT_IF
DIALOG | P_NAME | Not if we stand around talking about it. We better keep going.
DIALOG | Nada   | ...ok.

TAKE_MORE
DIALOG | P_NAME | It'll take more than a couple wimpy monsters to stop us!
DIALOG | Nada   | But they're so strong. I wouldn't want you to get hurt just for me.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hey, come on! Don't talk like that! You're worth it, aren't you? I was going to eventually come this way anyway. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | You know, I think you're looking at this all wrong.
DIALOG | Nada   | What? I am?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Sure you are. We're not out here running for our lives, we're explorers! Adventurers! 
DIALOG | P_NAME | Anybody can just wander around a town. That's easy. It's safe there, no monsters. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | The real tough guys find the place nobody thinks to go, the path that's grown over and filled with all kinds of sludge and nasty stuff. The place most people look at and just say "YUCK! WHO WANTS TO GO THERE!!" 
DIALOG | P_NAME | Most people just see the same stupid, boring things in their lives. The same four walls, the same people, the same routine. Just the same day over and over again. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | You know you're truly alive when you find something that only you get to see, something you had to search for, something special, like it was waiting there all along for you to find it.
DIALOG | Nada   | Wow!! Like what?
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't know! It could be anything. That's the fun of it all. If you knew what you were looking for, you wouldn't need to go find it. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | You might not always even know right away how valuable what you found was.
DIALOG | Nada   | That's so cool... 
DIALOG | Nada   | But you're the one doing all the work. I'm just hiding. I don't think this counts.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'm not out here alone. You're with me, and it takes a lot of bravery to come this far. We're a team out here. 
DIALOG | Nada   | A team? ___This is so great. So are you the Captain of the team?
DIALOG | P_NAME | No way! You're definitely the Captain. I'm just helping, this is your team.
DIALOG | Nada   | But I can't be the Captain! I'm just a kid. I think you need to be lots older to be a Captain!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Geez...hmm...no Captain... 
DIALOG | Nada   | Well who needs a Captain anyway? We're tough guys! We don't need someone telling us what to do! We can do anything we want!
DIALOG | Nada   | Yeah!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Let's get going, pal. We'll show these stupid monsters a thing or two about what it means to be a tough guy.

DIALOG | P_NAME | We're doing ok, aren't we? How are you holding out?
DIALOG | Nada   | Pretty good, thank you for asking. 
DIALOG | Nada   | But there's something that's been bothering me. I can't get it out of my mind.
QUESTION | Flap your gums?
REPLY  | NO_GUM_FLAP | Sorry, no time to talk.
REPLY  | FLAP_GUMS   | Is something wrong?"

NO_GUM_FLAP
DIALOG | P_NAME | Sorry, no time to talk. We need to stay focused...
DIALOG | Nada   | Yes, you're right. I'm sorry!

FLAP_GUMS
DIALOG | P_NAME | Is something wrong?
DIALOG | Nada   | Where are the food dispensers? What if people get hungry?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Are you hungry? I've got some food I can share.
DIALOG | Nada   | No! I'm ok! I'm just really curious! This is place is so strange.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Well there wouldn't be any food dispensers out here! If there were, the monsters would probably just eat them whole.
DIALOG | Nada   | Wow! Monsters can do that?!?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Some of them can! Monsters are really scary.
DIALOG | Nada   | No... monsters aren't going to eat us, are they? We're so close...
DIALOG | P_NAME | Not a chance. We're tough guys remember?
DIALOG | Nada   | Yeah! Tough guys!


DIALOG | Nada   | Phew! This is tiring. 
DIALOG | Nada   | Hey, can I ask you a question?
CHOICE | Take in a question?
REPLY  | NO_TIME_FOR_QUESTION | We don't really have time for questions.
REPLY  | SURE_WE_CAN_TALK     | Sure, we can talk a bit if you'd like.

NO_TIME_FOR_QUESTION 
DIALOG | P_NAME | We don't really have time for questions. Just keep digging. We'll make it.
DIALOG | Nada   | Ok! Sorry to bother you!

SURE_WE_CAN_TALK
DIALOG | P_NAME | Sure, we can talk a bit if you'd like.
DIALOG | Nada   | How did you learn to fight like this? Did your dad teach you?
DIALOG | P_NAME | I...____I don't know. I don't know if I had a dad.
DIALOG | Nada   | You...you don't have a dad?
DIALOG | P_NAME | I have amnesia. I don't remember anything. I can't remember anything before I got here. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | The word feels nice when I say it, though. ______Dad...______ I just feel warm when I say it. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't know...maybe it's nothing...
DIALOG | Nada   | I think you have a dad. You're too nice a person to not have a great dad. I bet he really misses you.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah. Must be nice knowing that he's waiting for you just up that mountain. Is your mom going to be there too?
DIALOG | Nada   | Well...it's just me and my dad. My mom died when she gave birth to me.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Oh no. That's awful. So you never got to meet your mom?
DIALOG | Nada   | Nope. I really miss my mom a lot. If I could have one wish it'd be to meet my mom, give her a big hug, and tell her I love her. 
DIALOG | Nada   | Hugs are really important, I think. Maybe the most important thing in the universe. I would give my mom the biggest hug ever. I just hope she'd give me a really big one back.
DIALOG | P_NAME | That's what I'd do if I could see my mom too. But at least you have your dad, right? You can hug him whenever you want.
DIALOG | Nada   | Uh...well, yeah, of course I can! But he's busy a lot with the railroads. He works really hard to make sure people have a great time on the railroads. I don't get to see him much.
DIALOG | P_NAME | That's more than I've got. I wish my dad was just up that mountain. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | I guess I don't have much of anything. Just me, you, and the hope that we'll find something great up that mountain.
DIALOG | Nada   | ..... 
DIALOG | Nada   | ...yeah.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Let's get going.


DIALOG | P_NAME | We're making really good time. I think we're almost there. I think I can see it from here.
DIALOG | Nada   | Yeah...*cough*...good. I'm really...___*cough*cough*cough*..._excited.
CHICE  | Hmm...
REPLY  | COME_ON | Come on, let's hurry. 
REPLY  | NO_GOOD | That doesn't sound good.

COME_ON
DIALOG | P_NAME | Come on, let's hurry. We're almost there!
DIALOG | Nada   | OK! *cough*cough*

NO_GOOD
DIALOG | P_NAME | That doesn't sound good. Are you all right?
DIALOG | Nada   | It's...*cough*...it's nothing. I got a mouthful of dirt. See, you're...*cough*cough*...you're supposed to close your mouth up tight when you're digging!! But I'm not good at it and I *cough* forgot.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Ok! Do you need to take a break?
DIALOG | Nada   | Yes. If it's not m-_...*cough*...much trouble.


DIALOG | P_NAME | We're just about there... We'll have plenty of time to take it easy when we get up there.
DIALOG | Nada   | *cough* Ok...


DIALOG | P_NAME | We can take a minute to catch our breath.
DIALOG | Nada   | Thank you. *cough.* 
DIALOG | Nada   | Can I ask you something?
DIALOG | P_NAME | You ask a lot of questions.
DIALOG | Nada   | Do I? *cough* I'm sorry.
DIALOG | P_NAME | No, it's ok. I kinda like it. Most people just talk at me. Nobody really cares what I have to say most of the time.
DIALOG | Nada   | I care! Nobody else *cough* listens to me either! You're my best friend!!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Thanks. So did you want to ask me something?
DIALOG | Nada   | Oh! *cough*cough* Yes! Do you ever feel bad for these monsters you kill?
DIALOG | P_NAME | Wow....____ That's a tough one. I guess sometimes I do, usually after. I don't like killing. I do it when I'm attacked. I'm just trying to protect myself.
DIALOG | Nada   | *cough*cough*cough* 
DIALOG | Nada   | Does it...*cough*cough*...does it ever make you sad?
DIALOG | P_NAME | That cough really doesn't sound good. Are you sure you're all right?
DIALOG | Nada   | I'm ok. Just a lot of dirt. *cough* I'm just bad at digging...
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah. Well, I don't know. I don't have a lot of time to think about the monsters while I'm fighting. You just get scared, I guess. I don't know...
DIALOG | Nada   | I'm...I'm sorry. I didn't want to make you feel bad.
DIALOG | P_NAME | No, it's all right. I guess the monsters are just hungry, or trying to protect their home. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | Most of them look pretty mean and stupid, but I guess they're just trying to protect what's important to them. They're probably really smart if you think about it all that way. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | I guess we really aren't any different. I'm out here with you, and I'm trying to keep you safe, but they don't really understand that. We're their monsters.
DIALOG | Nada   | Wow! I never thought about it...*cough*...thought about it that way. *cough*cough* Makes you feel sorry for them...
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah...
DIALOG | Nada   | Somebody should invent a gun that just makes monsters really lazy! They won't feel like fighting ever, they'll just sit around all day sleeping.
DIALOG | P_NAME | That's an awesome idea. Then we wouldn't have to fight.
DIALOG | Nada   | Yeah! *cough*cough*cough* 
DIALOG | Nada   | Do you think they'd understand? Why we made them sleep?
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't know. Probably not. It might even make them more angry and confused.
DIALOG | Nada   | Yeah... 
DIALOG | Nada   | *cough*cough*cough*cough* 
DIALOG | Nada   | I'm really tired. We better go now...
DIALOG | P_NAME | As you wish.


// The two characters walk on-screen, the player walks close to the edge, Nada standing behind.
DIALOG | Nada   | It's..._____ 
DIALOG | Nada   | It's beautiful...


DIALOG | P_NAME | Yep. I've been here before, but I'm not tired of the view yet.
DIALOG | Nada   | Must be great *cough* to come here whenever you want...

DIALOG | P_NAME | I didn't expect it to look like this. I've been to all those places..._____but none of them look like this up close...
DIALOG | Nada   | I'm so glad...*cough*cough*cough*____...we could come here... *cough*... together...


// Nada immediately falls down to her side, her eyes still fixed out on the view. The player notices and turns around.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I wore you out pretty good! So... Where's your dad? When's he going to meet us here?
// The player turns back around.
DIALOG | P_NAME | You know, it's been really fun traveling with you. We make a pretty good team after all. I was afraid we'd be somebody's lunch. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | We could get pretty good at this when we get older. I could teach you how to use a gun, you could teach me how to dig. We could just go around exploring, seeing what's out there waiting for us. I wouldn't have to travel alone again...____ We wouldn't have to travel alone again.
DIALOG | Nada   | ...
// The player turns and faces Nada again.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Still admiring the view?
DIALOG | Nada   | I...*cough*cough*______ 
DIALOG | Nada   | ...I don't have a dad.
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...What?
DIALOG | Nada   | I... *cough*... lied... about everything...*cough*
DIALOG | P_NAME | You're just joshing me now, aren't you? I should warn you, I can josh pretty hard myself!
DIALOG | Nada   | It's true... I don't have a...*cough*cough*...dad.___ I don't have anybody. I'm an orphan.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Why... 
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...Why would you lie to me about that? I'm pretty much an orphan too.
DIALOG | Nada   | It had to be...*cough*cough*...someone special...it had to be you...*cough* 
DIALOG | Nada   | It had to be...it just had to be...
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't understand any of this. What are you talking about? Why me? Why here?
DIALOG | Nada   | I was alone. *cough*cough* Even when I was really young they just put me in the cube and- *cough*cough*cough*cough*____ ignored me. Put my cube in the closet of the orphanage where nobody would have to look at me. *cough* They thought I was a monster. Moles aren't...*cough*cough*...aren't supposed to have eyes like mine. *cough* My eyes are *cough*cough* gross and disgusting...*cough*....other moles try not to even look at me... At first they'd *cough*cough* try to find parents for me, but everyone thought I was so disgusting that they'd change their - *cough*cough* ... Change their mind about adopting at all and just leave... *cough*cough*cough* Everyone was so mad at me. *cough*cough* I ruined everything. They closed down the orphanage eventually, sent the kids to other orphanages, and...*cough*...and just left me there in a storage locker. *cough*cough.____ Alone. In the cube. 
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't know what to say...____ 
DIALOG | P_NAME | This is..._ this is horrible... 
DIALOG | P_NAME | They just locked you in this cube because they didn't like the way you looked?
DIALOG | Nada   | ...no. *cough* They thought I was repulsive, but that wasn't the reason why I was in the cube...
DIALOG | Nada   | I have a...*cough*_ ...I have a disease... 
DIALOG | Nada   | Muldvarp immunodeficiency. Have you heard of it?
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't think so...
DIALOG | Nada   | It means I get sick really, really... *cough*cough* ...really easily. There's little bacteria and germs everywhere. Smaller than me even...*cough*cough* And most people have *cough*cough* little things in their body to fight against the germs.___ *cough*cough*___....I don't have that. This is extra bad for a mole. We have to...*cough*cough*cough*...dig through the ground to survive. But the ground- *cough*cough*cough*___ The ground has the most bacteria of everything. It just sucks up all the...*cough*...bacteria. It's everywhere. Small little poisons you can't even see. That's part of the reason why nobody wanted *cough*cough*cough* ...wanted me.
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...
DIALOG | Nada   | And what's why I had to stay in the cube..._*cough*cough*cough*cough*____...any germs at all and I could *cough*cough*cough*cough*..._ 
DIALOG | Nada   | ...I could die. The cube protected me. It was a sanitation cube. It *cough*cough*cough* protected me from the germs... 
DIALOG | Nada   | But I was so alone in the sanitation cube. It drove me crazy. Even when others were around I could never...*cough*cough*cough* touch anybody, or shake somebody's hand, or...*cough*cough*cough*...or just get a hug from somebody. Nobody ever wanted to hug me anyway, but even if they did....*cough*cough*cough*....I couldn't....
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...
DIALOG | Nada   | I was alone in the storage locker for so long. *cough*cough* Just... just forgotten. 
DIALOG | Nada   | They...*cough*cough*...turned on the food dispenser when they left, and never came back. *cough*cough*____ ...That was the last I ever talked to anybody.
// A pause. The player steps closer, takes a knee beside Nada.
DIALOG | Nada   | Eventually I found a travel brochure somebody left in the storage locker. *cough*cough* I could barely see it from my cube at first, and I didn't know what it was. It took me a really long time to even get it....*cough*cough*....I tried to make something to reach out of the cube, but that didn't *cough*cough*.....that didn't work. *cough*cough*cough*cough*....After a few months I built up the courage to step out and grab it. I was just outside for a moment, but I was sick for weeks after. I almost...*cough*cough*...I almost died... But it was so worth it. It was just *cough*cough*cough* five pages, but that little brochure was another universe to me. It was so....*cough*cough*cough*...it was so beautiful. My hands burnt just holding it, but I...*cough*...I didn't care. I went there so many times in my imagination.
DIALOG | Nada   | On the back page was an overlook...*cough*cough... this overlook. I dreamt so long of coming here once, just once. 
DIALOG | Nada   | For a long time I just thought it *cough*cough*cough*...it was just a stupid dream. But I knew deep down that I needed to come here once, even if it meant I would die. I spent weeks planning, finally built up the courage to go outside *cough*cough* once or *cough* twice. When I saw all the monsters I knew *cough*cough*...knew I couldn't do it alone. I was so sad...._____....until I heard somebody talk about this person named X114JAM9. You sounded so cool....*cough*cough*...but I was afraid you'd be like all the others. *cough*cough* That you'd just think I was disgusting and try not to look at me. That's when I came up with the story about my parents. *cough*cough* I thought if I promised you my...*cough*cough*...my rich father would pay you...maybe you would just...*cough*cough*cough*...  You'd just agree to take me there for the money, even if I was disgusting....
DIALOG | Nada   | But I was so wrong about you...*cough*cough*cough*...you're the best person in the whole universe. 
DIALOG | Nada   | To be so nice to such a gross and disgusting mole like me... *cough*cough*cough*_ there isn't enough rewards in all the universe to thank you for how good of a person you are... *cough*cough*....and how much you mean to me...... I...____I feel like I don't deserve somebody as great as you...____
DIALOG | P_NAME | No...that's not true...
DIALOG | Nada   | I don't know... *cough*cough*... 
DIALOG | Nada   | I'm nothing. I'm a zero. *cough*cough*cough* I don't exist. 
DIALOG | Nada   | Some kids get told they can be anything they wanted as long as they tried hard enough. ______ Nobody ever told me that. ___ I knew I could never be anything. I could only be in the cube.
// A long pause.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't know what to say..._ I..._
DIALOG | Nada   | *COUGH*COUGH*COUGH*COUGH*COUGH*COUGH* ... I don't... *COUGH*COUGH*COUGH*
DIALOG | P_NAME | No, Nada... 
DIALOG | P_NAME | Wait right here, I'll go get help.
DIALOG | Nada   | No!! *COUGH*COUGH*COUGH* NO!! 
DIALOG | Nada   | Don't... don't go... please don't leave me alone. 
DIALOG | Nada   | I've...*COUGH*...I've been alone so long. Everybody forgot about me. Just stay. I don't want you to forget about me too.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I'll never forget about you... we're a team... right?
DIALOG | Nada   | *COUGH*COUGH*COUGH*COUGH*... yeah... a team...
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...and we always will be.
DIALOG | Nada   | *COUGH*COUGH*COUGH*COUGH*COUGH*COUGH*COUGH*
// The player gets closer.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Please... is there anything I can do for you? Anything I can get you?
DIALOG | Nada   | No, X114JAM9 *cough*cough* You already gave me._._._ 
DIALOG | Nada   | ._._._._the universe_._._.
// Nada slumps down, dead.
DIALOG | P_NAME | No.....
// The player pauses for a long time.
DIALOG | P_NAME | No...Nada....
// The player stands up, slowly turns and looks out towards the view. The NPC Hilfenbach, a concerned citizen, appears from off-screen, stops below Nada and the player, and points a finger towards them.
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | Right there.
// Marshal Masego appears, stands behind Hilfenbach. The player turns around to face the two NPCs.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | You're fucking kidding me. He's just a kid.
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | But he's the one. I saw the two of them together outside the city. I followed her around town all day after I saw her leave the orphanage.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Yeah, yeah...
// Masego walks up to Nada, examines her.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Wait a minute....
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | The kid is dead....
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | Dead?
// Masego unholsters some sort of weapon, aims it at the player.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Don't you move one muscle, you fucking worm, or I'll blast you right off your feet.
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | Dead....no....if only I acted sooner.....I could have stopped this....
DIALOG | P_NAME         | What.....what are you doing....
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | You're coming with me to the police station. Someone needs to answer for this.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | You don't think that I murdered her, do you?
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | Looks like it to me, you monster!!!
// Masego turns to Hilfenbach.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Pipe down, I'm the law around here.
// Masego turns back to the player.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | I get a report that a kid from the orphanage was abducted, I come out to see the orphan dead and the kidnapper hanging around the dead body. Exactly what do you expect me to believe?
DIALOG | P_NAME         | She...she always wanted to come here. She wanted to see the overlook. So I took her.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | So when did you decide to kill her?
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | Horrible....
DIALOG | P_NAME         | I didn't kill her!!! She was really sick. She said she had a disease where she gets sick real easily.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | This just keeps getting better and better. So you knew she had this disease, so you just took her out anyway? 
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | What, so you could just see her die? Is that how you get your kicks?
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | I can't imagine.....this is dreadful....
DIALOG | P_NAME         | No, it wasn't like that at all, I-
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Shut up. You're a disgusting goddamn monster, and I'm here to bring you in.
// Masego closes in on the player.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | We can make this as easy or as hard as you want it. I'd suggest not fighting it. I'm not in the best of moods right now.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | I didn't want her to die!! She was my friend!!! You have to believe me!!!
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Enough of this.

// A couple ways we could do this. Either Masego attacks or stuns the player to temporarily knock them out, or we can see her attack and cuff her. I like the idea of her just using a taser on him or something, fading to black and into the next screen where he's already there. A little simpler that way(we'd just need a player getting electrocuted graphic), we don't need to come up with graphics of the player getting walked back to the police station in handcuffs. So I'm writing this dialogue that way.
// The screen fades in to the player on the floor of the police station office. Masego and Hilfenbach are there. Masego is dealing with some paperwork.

DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | He's awake.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | You, get up.
// A pause.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | I SAID GET UP.
// The player gets to their feet, either automatically or by input(doesn't matter).
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | We're getting the last of the details of your crime squared away. You can answer a couple questions without lying through your teeth, can't you?
DIALOG | P_NAME         | .....
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | I don't feel comfortable standing so close to this...this...thing.....
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | I've got my eye on him, don't worry. Just a couple questions, Hilfenbach, then he'll be stuck in one of those cells where he can't do anybody any harm.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | So....where were we... 
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Oh yeah, the deceased resided at storage locker 27b-6?
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | Yes, ma'am.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Who owns this storage locker?
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | Joint ownership between Orphanage Corp. Liquidation Holdings and Sanzot the Butcher.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | She said she was all alone there. She was trapped.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | And now she's dead. Not exactly BETTER OFF right now, is she?
// A pause.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | IS SHE?
DIALOG | P_NAME         | I....I don't know.....
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | Do you have that little compassion for life? Are you really that terrible?
DIALOG | P_NAME         | ......
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | Answer me. Can you possibly be that twisted?
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Hilfenbach....
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | ANSWER ME.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Hilfenbach!! Let's let the law handle this.
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | This is just so terrible.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | .....
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | The more we talk, the more time we waste before we lock this crook up. Let's stick to the facts, try to keep our personal opinions out of this... even if it's pretty hard to keep from knocking this little punk out. But I've got a job to do...
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | So let's see...what else do we have here... 
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Were you related to the deceased?
DIALOG | P_NAME         | ...what?
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | Were you RELATED? Were you family.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | No...
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | How would you characterize your relationship with the deceased?
DIALOG | P_NAME         | She was my._._._my friend._._._
DIALOG | Hilfenbach     | You'd do that to a friend? What kind of sick monster does that to a friend?
DIALOG | P_NAME         | You wouldn't understand....
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | I've heard enough. Just looking at you makes me sick. Come with me.
// Masego drags the player to one of the jail cells, the player gets violently thrown in, smashing against the wall. Masego shits and locks the cell door.
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | If you learn one thing from this it's that this punishment is too good for someone as disgusting as you. Part of me wants to just put a bullet right in your head, rid the world of such a villain. But I'm not going to do that. I want you to sit there and think about this, realize that as easy as you can rip someone else's life away, someone can come and rip just as much away from you.
DIALOG | P_NAME         | ......
DIALOG | Marshal Masego | And all you can do is sit there smugly staring back. Consider yourself fortune that I'm just too kind-hearted of a person to sink down to your level. If anyone deserves worse, it's you.

// Masego walks away. Time increases by 1.
