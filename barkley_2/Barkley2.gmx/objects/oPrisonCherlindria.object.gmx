DIALOG | Cherlindria | Like I said, they are a `w1`shadowy group.`w0` Best way I could describe is this:_
DIALOG | Cherlindria | You know how there is a sort of `kw`spiritual energy,`rt`_ an ethereal substance that streams beneath the surface of all planets in the galaxy?
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Yeah, the `kw`the Lifestream.`rt` Everyone knows that. 
DIALOG | Cherlindria | Well there also a kind of `kw`fiduciary energy,`rt`_ a force that influences all market transactions and exchanges. The Guilderbergs are stewards of that financial ebb and flow.
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Sounds like a powerful force...
DIALOG | Cherlindria | Maybe,_ `sq`ask Chandragupta in Brain City for more information.`rt` Anything else?
GOTO   | INFO_CHOICE

LOTSOFMONEY
DIALOG | P_NAME      | This cheque is for... wow, like `w1`9 hundred billion Cuchu-bucks.`w0` Isn't that a ton of money?
DIALOG | Cherlindria | You obviously aren't so knowledgeable on the intricacies of numismatics.
DIALOG | P_NAME      | I guess I'm not.
DIALOG | Cherlindria | Cuchu-bucks are a new `kw`hypnocurrency.`rt` It's new, it's got the backing of that inglorious basterd Cuchulainn, but for now, it doesn't have much financial clout. And that makes it vulnerable. `kw`Operation: Reverse Dunkirk`rt` is looking to exploit that. `kw`Chandragupta`rt` could probably tell you the rest.
