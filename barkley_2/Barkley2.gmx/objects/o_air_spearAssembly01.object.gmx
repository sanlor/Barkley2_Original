JUST_A_FORGE
DIALOG | P_NAME | A forge of some sort. Very cool looking.

REPORT_TO_CDWARF
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't have time to look at this beautiful forge. I must report back to Cyberdwarf, ASAP.

PIECES_ONE
DIALOG | P_NAME | This is the forge upon which the Cyberspear will be restored. But... I have only found one piece so far. There is still three more to go.

PIECES_TWO
DIALOG | P_NAME | This is the forge upon which the Cyberspear will be restored. But... I have only found two pieces so far. There is still two more to go.

ASSEMBLE_CHOICE
DIALOG | P_NAME | I've gathered all the pieces of the Cyberspear. Now all I have to do is to manufact the full Cyberspear from these pieces.
CHOICE | Assemble the Cyberspear?
REPLY  | ASSEMBLE_YAY | No turning back now!
REPLY  | ASSEMBLE_NAY | No, turning back now!

ASSEMBLE_YAY
DIALOG | P_NAME | Okay, here goes nothing.
// Pieces fly out, whirl and twirl and assemble into the spear OR Hoopz just places them on a pedestal and the spear is mended whole //
WAIT   | 2
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzShock | It..._ It's so beautiful...
WAIT   | 1
DIALOG | P_NAME | Come to me, Cyberspear. We have a nasty ghoul to destruct.
