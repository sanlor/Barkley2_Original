WHOAMI
DIALOG | P_NAME | Who am I?_ I... I don't remember who I am, Clispaeth. I don't know who I used to be or where I came from or what any of this Cyberdwarf stuff I've been thrown into has to do with me. All I know is that the Cyberdwarf knows something and that I've got to find him... Clispaeth, did I used to be a bad person? Whatever I did to get tangled up in all this stuff... was I one of the bad guys? I guess that's the thing I'm most scared of, knowing who I used to be... because... because if I was one of the bad guys, maybe I do deserve this. That's all.

HOME
DIALOG | P_NAME | ... going home. I woke up without my memory in the generator room of the dwarf space ziggurat Necron 7 and have been pushed around by people I don't know ever since. I don't know where I am or where I'm going or what's happening or why I'm being forced to do this crazy stuff. I don't know what the deal with Cuchulainn or the dwarfs or Cyberdwarf is... I... I just wanna go home. But I don't even know where that is. I... probably sound like I'm whining right now, don't I, Clispaeth? I'm sorry. That's not how I mean to sound. I can take care of myself and I'm learning that I can take care of other people too. But... but I'm still just a kid. I want to shoot hoops with my friends and play vidcons and eat candy. This Cyberdwarf stuff... I get it, it's my responsibility now. There are questions that need to be answered and things that need to be done. But... but I wish I wasn't the one who had to do them. I just want to go home...
GOTO   | POSTPRAYER   

CUCHU
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...Cuchulainn. Now this guy's a real piece of work. I spent some time in Tir na Nog, this ghetto where Cuchulainn's been rounding up dwarfs and let me tell you, he really gets my goat. And get this: apparently he was keeping me in some sort of stasis and using my body as a generator for the Necron 7. I mean, what the cluck? He could have at least thrown me a permission waiver or something. And here's the weird thing - nobody's actually seen or knows who this guy is. This may just be a hunch, but I think something weird's going on. I'm going to gumshoe my way to bottom of this one way or another...
GOTO   | POSTPRAYER             

RESPON
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...responsibility. With Cuchulainn and the Cyberdwarf and the dwarfs and everything... Being thrust into all this crazy stuff that I don't know the first thing about. Why does it have to be me? Why do I have to do this Cyberdwarf stuff, help all those dwarfs? But... I guess looking out for people who can't look out for themselves is part of being a good person. It's... it's pretty tough to be the good guy sometimes, and I wish it didn't have to be me. I want to go home. I just... I don't want any of this. I'm a kid. I want to shoot hoops with my friends and go to school and play vidcons and eat candy. But I guess it's part of growing up, being responsible. I didn't want this, but sometimes you've gotta live with what you've been given, make grapeade out of grapes. That's what dad always used to say.

DIALOG | P_NAME | ...dad?
GOTO   | POSTPRAYER  
        
BBALL
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...b-ball. People don't really seem to care much about b-ball around here, do they? It kind of stinks... I mean, I love b-ball. I wish I had someone to talk to about it. Like layups and dunks and stuff. I guess I just feel kind of alone... nobody to talk to about my interests or anything... it really stinks. I wish I had someone to hang out with or play a quick round, maybe some horse or something. I dunno. Well, I don't want to take up your time. I'm sure you've got way more important stuff to hear about than freethrows.

GIVEME
DIALOG | P_NAME | I know it's been a while, Clispaeth, and I'm sorry. I try to be a good Klispin but sometimes it's hard, especially with the way things have been. I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can, there's something I'd like to ask of you. This might sound kind of selfish, and I'm sorry, but I need you right now Clispaeth. I'd like...

I need to get better with gun's in every conceivable way and more importantly, I need to get better at fusing them.

POWER_ZAUB
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...zaubers. I want to be the most powerful zaubermancer in the galaxy, more powerful than the great Balthios of the James dynasty. I want the power of the zaubers to destroy Cuchulainn and free the dwarfs of Necron 7. But I also want to explore their ancient and cosmic wisdom, study their forgotten insights and ponder the forbidden philosophies of the zaubermancers of old. I want the power of the zaubers because of their potential to reshape reality to my desires. That's what I want. Amen.

POWER_TECH
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...technology. There are answers I need and people I need to protect but I can't do it the way I am now. I want to upgrade my body to do things nobody else can do. I want to run faster, see farther, ball harder than anyone who's ever lived. I want to be something more than I am, something... post-human. Clispaeth, I don't know if you can hear me, but if you can, I want you to give me the power of technology so I can face the dangers ahead and help the dwarfs... amen.
