DIALOG | Stonewall | Beautiful... simply beautiful. My congratulations to bride and groom - may your marriage be long and happy. But enough of this wedding puck, that's not why you're here. It's time for the main course, the soup du jour, the moment everyone's been waiting for, Brain City's very own.......... JAAAAAAAAZZY RAAAAAASCAAAAAAALS!!!

DIALOG | Stonewall | Now before the band starts playing, I'd like to take a moment to introduce everyone...

WAYNE_HAVE
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Stonewall | He's not much of a talker, but it don't matter when he's 'doo'ing his thang! Shreddin' the keyboard is Waaaaayne!

POLY_HAVE

DIALOG | Stonewall | She may be loud and she may love to fight, but Clispaeth help me if this gal can't rock'n'roll! On drums is Pooooooly!
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Poly      | Cut the cruft Stonewall, let's get this shit goin'!

GUILLAUME_HAVE
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Stonewall | His bizarre new age schtick may seem anachronistic, maybe even meaningless four millenia after the hippie movement, but there's nothing culturally irrelevant about his musical chops. On guitar is Guillaaaaaaaaume!
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Guillaume | I'm feelin' it... I'm feelin' the love, I'm feelin' the vibes! My chakras are on the fritz, maaan!

DINAH_HAVE
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Stonewall | This cyberdelic datapunk may be new to the performing game, but her drum programming is second to none. Rockin' the drum machines iiiiiis Diiiiiinah!
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Dinah     | Hope you guys like four on the floor rhythms because that's all I can do so far.

ZALMOXIS_HAVE
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Stonewall | One part enigmatic and two parts contemptuous, hailing from the cryptic halls of the Death Tower is the one and only cuicamancer, Zaaaaaaaalmoxis!
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Zalmoxis  | Hmph. It's time to enlighten you ignoramuses to the splender of my cuica zauber.

CAPN_HAVE
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Stonewall  | She's spent her life aplunderin' booty on the high seas (my kinda woman!) but now she's here to steal our hearts with her music. On accordion is the dread pirate... Cap'n Jaaaaaaaaane!
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Cap'n Jane | Arrrr! Don't look at me like that, I'm only doin' this for the money!

WIZARD_HAVE
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Stonewall | With an instrument bigger than most of his bandmates, this bull-headed bassist is as kvlt as he is gigantic! Is he even a dwarf? Iiiiiit's WIIIIIIIIZARD
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | WIZARD    | I DEDICATE THIS WAR DIRGE TO THE UNHOLY SERPENT WHOSE BLASPHEMY DESECRATES THE SPIRITS OF IMPURE PROFLIGATES.
    
BORIS_HAVE    
WAIT   | 0
DIALOG | Stonewall | To be honest, it seems like there's somethin' wrong with this guy. But whether or not he's a sex offender, he's great at that flute. Iiiiiiit's Booooooris!
