DIALOG | Rene   | Well, I'll be! It's been a blue moon since I saw anything with an amiable set of gums around here.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I... excuse me?
DIALOG | Rene | Your gums, young friend. I'm talking about your gums! 
DIALOG | P_NAME | ...
DIALOG | Rene | Generally, when I see a set of gums, they aren't so friendly. Most nasties and ghoulies and creepy-crawlies around here don't know aught but to use their gums for trying to take a bite out of yours truly.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Wow, that sounds really terrifying. Nasties, ghoulies, AND creepy-crawlies?
DIALOG | Rene | That's right, that's right. There's all kinds of alien-like horrors out and about here, their gums just salivating at the thought of their next victim. Can you imagine the terror of that? Have you ever had to face down an opponent that meant to take your life?
CHOICE | Ever been in a combat situation before?

DIALOG | Rene | Please, just go, P_NAME. I want nothing to do with a blabbergums.

SEEN_COMBAT
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah, I've been at the wrong end of someone's wakizashi before. It's not always easy to go through life like that, wondering if your next undertaking will be your last, pondering when will come the inevitable day that you finally meet an opponent who is faster and more cunning with their gun's than you, but you know something?
DIALOG | Rene | What?
DIALOG | P_NAME | I wouldn't have it any other way. Everyone has to die, but when I go, I'll know exactly where I stood. I'll know who I had the skills to defeat. I'll know who had the skills to defeat me. Whatever worlds awaits beyond, I'll go to it with dignity, having both lived and died in a flash of the blade.
DIALOG | Rene | A stoic and proud response, young friend. I daresay I've taken a liking to the way your jib is cut. Name's Rene.
GOTO | RENE_INTRO_2

NOT_SEEN_COMBAT
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hm... I'm thinking back as far as I can remember, but for the life of me I can't recall a single time I've ever been engaged in a battle.

DIALOG | P_NAME | And I'm P_NAME. So what are you doing in this place, Mr. Rene?
DIALOG | Rene | Just Rene, please. And right now? I'm just flapping my gums with you, P_NAME. Like I said, lot of real bad monsters around this place, but they don't seem to take interest in this here room. Too many fresh fruits and vegetables, maybe.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Fresh fruits and vegetables?
DIALOG | Rene | That's right. This is a cafeteria, after all. Now, open wide.
DIALOG | P_NAME | I beg pardon?
DIALOG | Rene | Your mouth, P_NAME. Open it up and let me see your gums. Open up and just say `w1`aaaaaaaah`w0`.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzShock | `w1`Aaaaaaaah`w0`.
DIALOG | Rene | Hm... yes, yes. Looks good. Everything appears to be in order here. Looks like you still have the majority of your teeth, no alarming lumps or abrasions, and you're only in the early stages of periodontitis. Alright, you can go ahead and close your mouth now.

DIALOG | Rene | Alright, it's official! I'm giving you permission to eat my cooking at this cafeteria. You seem to have gums fit to do the job, P_NAME. It'd be a disservice not to let those beauts squish down on some of my fine culinary creations.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Wait, you're going to let me eat your cooking? Really? Thanks, Rene! Thanks a lot!
DIALOG | Rene | Oh, don't mention it, P_NAME. It's not often I get visitors around here. I feel practically indentured to at least provide some form of hospitality.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Still, I haven't really gotten the chance to eat freshly cooked meals lately. I wish there was something I could to do pay you back.
DIALOG | Rene | Just being able to hold a friendly conversation is gift enough for me. I haven't given these gums a good workout in forever. You just stop back on in whenever you want to and I'll whip you up something healthy and tasty.

MENU_RESULT_1
IF reneFoodChoice == 0 | DIALOG | Rene | Ah, Microwaved Chipmunk Guts Gumbo. One of my personal favorites. Now, I think you can tell that importing the guts from off-zigguraut is probably pretty difficult, so I won't deny the secret is that the guts are artificial. But to be honest, I don't think you'll be able to tell the difference. 
IF reneFoodChoice == 0 | DIALOG | Rene | What I do is I hollow out a celery stick, fill it tortilla chips that I fermented overnight until they were a fine paste, and boil that for a few hours. And there you have it. Instant chipmunk guts.
IF reneFoodChoice == 1 | DIALOG | Rene | Well, I don't actually have dingo feet in the back, but I have plenty of kangaroo feat. Those are in abundant supply, although for a while, kangaroos were nearly hunted to exctinction. Something about a movie where a kangaroo takes stolen money from thieves, I hear.
IF reneFoodChoice == 1 | DIALOG | Rene | But on the bright side, I think making a kangaroo foot taste like a dingo foot is really easy. Slather it in mayonnaise and deep fry it and you're good to go. Trust me, P_NAME. This gumbo is a real treat every time.
IF reneFoodChoice == 2 | DIALOG | Rene | That's funny. I don't remember putting that on the menu. But how hard can it be? Maple syrup tastes good and gumbo tastes good. Mix them together and you've got a recipe for deliciousness. And don't tell anyone, but just because I like you, I'll throw in some extra soy sauce.
IF reneFoodChoice == 3 | DIALOG | Rene | Excellent choice! One of my personal favorites. First I start with nine delicious varities of beans: garbanzo, pinto, frijoles negros, kidney, and um... I forget the rest. But I mash them all up until they're a fine pasty ball. Then I begin rolling in various fruits and candied ginger.
IF reneFoodChoice == 3 | DIALOG | Rene | I then mix in tap water until it becomes liquidy enough that I can legally call it gumbo and serve it at 79 degrees Farenheit. It's a little on the gummy side but it tastes so good, you'd pay nearly four million neuroshekels for a bowl!
IF reneFoodChoice == 4 | DIALOG | Rene | You want a pie? Well, normally I suggest the gumbo, but something about your `kw`pious`rt` demeanor makes me feel that this is right for you. My pie is something special if I do say so myself. Most people cook their pies in the oven, right? Well, my little secret is that I cook it on the heat sink of the computer I've got in back. 
IF reneFoodChoice == 4 | DIALOG | Rene | Trust me on this: the results are delicious. And when you consider that I use only the freshest wasp honey and crocodile eggs to pair up with the strawberries? It's a feast for both the eyes and the gums. 
CHOICE | Is this the dish for which you wish?

DIALOG | P_NAME | Oh, well I'll just try that, then. You don't need to try anything new and fancy to impress me, Rene. It's good enough just to be able to eat good food and share a few precious moments with a friend.
DIALOG | Rene | It's not that simple, P_NAME. See, the dish I know how to make well is actually called `kw`Alien Gum Gumbo`rt`. It has a secret ingredient which is very hard to come by.
DIALOG | P_NAME | A secret ingredient? What is it?
DIALOG | Rene | No, I can't possibly tell you. I like you, P_NAME. I really do, but what if turns out that you have loose gums? Loose gums sever thumbs, you know! You might blab and my secret recipe for `kw`Alien Gum Gumbo`rt` would be known to all. I just don't know if I could handle that.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Please, Rene. I only want to help you. If you tell me the secret ingredient in `kw`Alien Gum Gumbo`rt`, I might be able to get it for you.

DIALOG | P_NAME | Nope. Flub that. Pinky promises are for the birds, buddy, let alone a triple.
DIALOG | Rene | As I figured. Placing the innermost depths of your dignity on the line revealed the truth of your character, P_NAME. Had I told you the secret ingredient in `kw`Alien Gum Gumbo`rt`, you'd have gone blabbing with those loose gums of yours to every person you know. I was wrong to offer you my hospitality, P_NAME. I thought I felt something special in you, something good. It seems I was wrong. Please leave.

DIALOG | Rene | Alien gums.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | Alien gums?!
DIALOG | Rene | Yes. If you truly wish to help me, you'll need to slay the aliens here in the power plant. In death, I have found that they are far less resistant to having their gums removed from their mouth.
DIALOG | P_NAME | And how many alien gums do you need?
DIALOG | Rene | Exactly thirteen. No more, no less. Certainly, you're welcome to collect more, but I only have enough of my other ingredients for one bowl, and one bowl will require thireen sets of alien gums.
DIALOG | P_NAME | If I happen to find them, I'll bring them back to you.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Thank you, P_NAME. Please be careful, though.

IF knowPowerPlant == 3 | DIALOG | Rene | Hm... no, I don't really know anything about weird eggs. I do know that eggs are high in phosphorous, which is good for your teeth and gums. Other than that, though? Sorry to say it, P_NAME, but I never go up to the second floor if I can help it.
IF knowPowerPlant &lt; 3 | DIALOG | P_NAME | What can you tell me about this power plant? How is Necron 7 still getting any power when it's abandoned?
IF knowPowerPlant &lt; 3 | DIALOG | Rene | It's, um._._._ Gosh, P_NAME, I don't really know anything about power and joules-watts and polaric inversity and all that. I do know that the lower floor was mostly for administrative purposes. Human resources, customer service, the cafeteria here, you name it. If you want to see the real meat and potatoes of this place, you'd need to head upstairs, but even I never go up there.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Why not?
DIALOG | Rene | Just a little too dangerous outside of the cafeteria for my liking. Aliens are always uppity and it doesn't take an ace gumshoe like yourself to notice the labyrinthine nature of this place.
DIALOG | P_NAME | That's true. Even this cafeteria felt like nothing more than a lucky find to me. It makes me wish I had a map or something.
DIALOG | Rene | Oh, you want a map? Sure, I can whip one up for you!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Wait, really? You'd do that for me?
DIALOG | Rene | Sure, P_NAME. I can't very well send you back out without one. Not in good conscience, I can't, at least. I've got a computer back there with state-of-the-art graphics editing software. You just give me a few minutes and I'll get you a map of the first floor.

DIALOG | P_NAME =  s_port_hoopzHappy | Yeah! Oh, man, I wish I had that much time to play vidcons, but I'm on this important quest here on Necron 7, so I can't. Vidcons are great but it's so hard to find the time for them sometimes. The first time I ever played Densetsu no Sword, my playtime was in the triple digits. It's one of my favorite games of all time, though! Are you excited about-
DIALOG | Rene | Whoa, slow down, P_NAME. I'm sorry to tell you but I don't know much about vidcons.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSad | Oh...
DIALOG | Rene | Well, don't look so sad now. I said I don't know much but I do know a little something. I've got an old beater of a computer back there and it's got a copy of American Football Draft Simulator 2002. It's not much but I think it requires at least some gumption to outdraft the other teams in the league.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | That's great! Maybe when I have more free time and I get all of my memories back, I can come back and show you Densetsu no Sword and you can show me whatever it was you were just talking about!
