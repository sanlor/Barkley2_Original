DIALOG | Frog Kid | Hey, P_NAME. I'd talk about frogs with you but I'm not really in the mood, sorry. Come back later and we'll do it though, I promise.

DIALOG | Frog Kid | Hi P_NAME! There's a lot I gotta tell ya, but first, let's see if you've done it. Are you really the Frog Master I think you are!?
               
DIALOG | Frog Kid | ... I'm feeling a little down right now, P_NAME. Maybe later... maybe we can talk about frogs later.
    
DIALOG | Frog Kid | You really do know a ton about frogs, huh? You've been studying?
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Thanks, I guess I am picking things up. I've learned a ton just by listening to you.
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Really!? THAT'S AWESOME! I want to spread love and knowledge of frogs around the world! I think everyone should know about frogs!!!
DIALOG | P_NAME   | That's nice that you want to share, Frog Kid. How do you know so much about them anyway?
DIALOG | Frog Kid | I um... um... I JUST LIKE THEM, OKAY!?!?
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Whoa... okay! I didn't mean anything by it, Frog Kid. I'm starting to like frogs a lot too. Is something wrong?
DIALOG | Frog Kid | I'm sorry... I'll have to tell you later. I um... I think I'm gonna go for a swim! See ya later, P_NAME!

DIALOG | Frog Kid | You're like a frog expert now, P_NAME!
DIALOG | P_NAME   | You think so!? Cool, Frog Kid! I'm just trying to keep up with you!
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Well you are doing great! You know a ton about frogs... um... wanna talk some more?
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Hey, sorry for getting upset with you last time we talked. You know... last time we talked about frogs. We're best friends, so I should be able to tell you anything. I can tell you anything, right!?    
          

DIALOG | P_NAME   | Maybe not anything-anything. What kind of anything are we talking about.
DIALOG | Frog Kid | I promise it's nothing bad, " + P_NAME + ". It's just that there's another reason I like frogs so much. I told you about my parents... and how they left me my Toader action figure. I don't really remember much about my parents.

DIALOG | P_NAME   | I think you're a Frog Kid, definitely! You've got those like... flipper things on your hands. You're definitely a frog something.
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Okay... cool. Well I'll see you later, P_NAME. I've got a lot to think about... about myself... and frogs. Bye bye!!!
            
DIALOG | P_NAME   | I think you're just a kid. A kid who likes frogs.
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Hmm... maybe I am just a kid. Yeah... that's pretty easy! Okay! Good bye, P_NAME. Come by again sometime!
               
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Incredible! You're becoming a true frog genius!
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Heh, you're embarrassing me, Frog Kid! But I've definitely picked up a little frog knowledge after meeting you, it's true!
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Wanna know something fun, P_NAME? After last time we talked, I found a sunny spot and laid down for a nap. Did you know frogs are cold-blooded? It means they have to regulate their body heat with the sun! So I did too... and I had a weird dream.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Really? Tell me about it! I heard dreams tell the future... or are the window to your true mind... or something like that anyway!
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Well, this one was kind of a a flashback I think. I was myself in the dream, and I was smaller. Maybe younger. Maybe a baby. And I felt different... I knew I was supposed to be myself, but I didn't feel quite like myself... it felt weird. Maybe it's because in my dream I wasn't in the swamp. I was in an apartment, in a big building, in a big city. I was sitting on the floor playing, but I was playing with a different toy... not Toader.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Toys are fun. That sounds like a pretty fun dream already.
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Well then it got weird! I heard my mom and dad talking to me, but their words were all garbled up and I couldn't understand what they were saying at all. And I kept playing with my toy. And then they kept talking, and I still played with my toy. But I could tell they were talking to me. And then finally they shouted at me and I still couldn't understand it so I looked up and... P_NAME... my mom had a frog head.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Whoa...
DIALOG | Frog Kid | I think she was a dwarf up to her shoulders, then a slimy green frog head! My mom opened her mouth and a ribbit came out, so I looked to my dad. He looked just like a regular dwarf... then suddenly I blinked and he was a frog too! And he croaked at me! Then I looked back at my mom, and this time, she had a dwarf head... and then I blinked and she was back to frog! Every time I looked away it was, frog, dwarf, frog, dwarf!
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Um... I have a question to ask you. I don't really remember my parents very much... but I don't think they had frog faces. Should that have freaked me out?
CHOICE | Is that freaky?
REPLY  | No way, Frog Kid! You might even be half-frog.
REPLY  | Yeah, definitely. You've got issues.

DIALOG | P_NAME   | I don't think so. You're the Frog Kid, right? Who cares if your parents have frog heads!? Maybe one of your parents was a frog.
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Yeah... I think you're right, " + P_NAME + "! I wasn't freaked out... I actually felt a lot better when I looked up and they had frog heads... better than dwarf heads, I think. After that, I looked around and I was in the swamp again. And I looked at my toy, and it was my Toader action figure. And my parents were gone, and there were just normal frogs around... a bunch of normal frogs, just hopping around! And then I woke up. Anyway... thanks for listening, " + P_NAME + "! I'm gonna go play somewhere else. Come back and see me! Bye bye!
           
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Definitely. It's a sign of some repressed issues. You've got some kind of... some kind of... Frog Complex.
DIALOG | Frog Kid | A Frog Complex... no! No! You're wrong! I just like frogs!!! I thought you were different, P_NAME!!! But you don't understand either!!!
              
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Good stuff as always! I don't know if there's anything else I can teach you about frogs, the way things are. By the way, P_NAME... ever since you left, since last time we talked, I've been thinking a whole lot. A WHOLE lot... and I've decided! I LOVE my life with the frogs!!!
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Yeah, I've picked that much up, Frog Kid.
DIALOG | Frog Kid | That's what I'm saying! I'm the Frog Kid, but... I wanna be the Frog Kid for real! I spend all day in the swamp! I love the swamp and I love playing with frogs! ... but I used to be sad about my parents. I don't want to be sad anymore!!! I didn't want to forget them for a long time, but they're not coming back. I don't care anymore! I don't care if I'm part-dwarf, or a half-frog, or what I am! I want to be a frog!!!
DIALOG | P_NAME   | A full-time frog, huh? Well...
CHOICE | About that...
REPLY  | You should go for it! Be a frog!
REPLY  | Stay a dwarf. Your parents are out there.           

DIALOG | P_NAME   | I think you should go for it! Go ahead and be a frog! Or... if you're the Frog Kid now, I guess that would make you a tadpole, wouldn't it?
DIALOG | Frog Kid | A tadpole, huh? That's a baby frog! You're right, P_NAME! You've learned a lot about frogs, haven't you!?
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Haha, thanks! I'm just trying to keep up with you!
DIALOG | Frog Kid | I knew you were my best friend for a reason! Okay, I'm doing it! Next time you see me, I'm gonna be a tadpole! I'm tired of being just the Frog Kid! Frogs are my life!!! I'm gonna jump! I'm gonna be slimy! I'm gonna swim! I'm gonna be a frog, really soon!!! Bye bye, P_NAME! Come and see me soon!

DIALOG | P_NAME   | I know you must miss your parents, but I don't think you should give up on your dwarfdom. I'm sure they're out there somewhere!
DIALOG | Frog Kid | Grrrrrr! I don't even know why I asked! I'm just tired of it!!! Look at these frogs, P_NAME! I wanna jump and swim and be slimy and sticky and eat bugs!!! So... I'm... gonna! Catch you later, P_NAME!
