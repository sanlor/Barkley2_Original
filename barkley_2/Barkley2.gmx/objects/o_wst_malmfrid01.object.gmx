DIALOG | Malmfrid | Concord grapes... Pinot Noir... Cabernet... Malbec...
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Uh, are you okay dude? Your eyes are grapeshot...
DIALOG | Malmfrid | Huh, grapes...? Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm okay. I'm good. Hey, do you think you could spot me a grape or something? Maybe even just a raisin. Just a grape skin.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | I don't have any right now. But uh, do you have a grape problem?
DIALOG | Malmfrid | Me? ME? Haha, no way. Not me. No. But back in Tir na Nog I might have had a problem. Yeah, back before I met Lonnie and the gang it might have been a problem. But I'm in good shape now. Look at me - I can handle myself, see? I wouldn't be out here if I couldn't handle myself. That's why I'm comfortable having a grape from time to time. Besides, we wouldn't be going to Shangri-La if I had a problem. Grapes of every flavor, every variety there. I'm not shitting you, kid. They've got grapes off the deep end. So keep your grapes, I don't care, we'll be in Grapester's Paradise pretty soon.
QUEST  | malmfridState = 1

MALM1
DIALOG | Malmfrid | Hey, hey, kid... let's keep this on the down low, okay? You uh... you got any grapes?
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Nope, no grapes. Sorry.
DIALOG | Malmfrid | It's all good. Yeah, it's fine. You know where we're heading? Shangri-La. It's real, dude, a never-ending vineyard with grapes of every flavor. Every. Single. Grape. I'm not shitting you dude, grapes you couldn't even dream of - you thought Concords were off the deep end? Two words: Thompson's Seedless. We'll be gorging ourselves on these bad boys 'til we explode.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | That doesn't really sound too healthy. Maybe you should lay off the grapes, Malmfrid.
DIALOG | Malmfrid | I'm just havin' some fun, kid. I can quit whenever I want. Chill out, you're a real buzzkill.
QUEST  | malmfridState = 2

MALM2
DIALOG | Malmfrid | I'm shivering just thinking about all the grapes in Shangri-La! We're gonna be millionaires, kid. We're gonna have enough grapes for every dwarf in Tir na Nog. I'm gonna build a mansion and have a little vineyard in the back, have my servants take care of it. You'll see. We're gonna hit it big.
