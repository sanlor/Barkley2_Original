   He moves backward in time while everyone else moves forward
   
   Variables:

        0 = first stage, haven't met Ludwig, he knows you
        1 = second stage, Ludwig is defeated by Hoopz not knowing him
        2 = the exchange of Hoopz knowing Ludwig and Ludwig forgetting
        3 = the question segment where you can ask Ludwig to go with you (NOTE there is no reason to move from 3 to 4 in the quest variable, but I did because it was set up this way and can be reverted if we don't like the questioning)
        4 = Ludwig forgets Hoopz
        5 = Ludwig is born, then dissapears

LUDWIG0
DIALOG | Ludwig | Hey, P_NAME_S. I'm surprised you aren't tired of talking with me yet.
DIALOG | Ludwig | Not that I have anything against you, I really like talking with you. I'm fortunate you're even talking to me. It's just...
DIALOG | P_NAME | Excuse me, have we met before?
DIALOG | Ludwig | Yeah... yeah, we met before. You really don't remember me?
DIALOG | P_NAME | ... no.
DIALOG | Ludwig | Just as well. I'd hate to mess up your life any more than I already have...
DIALOG | Ludwig | Thanks for talking with me as long as you have. It means a lot that you tried.

DIALOG | P_NAME | What do you mean we've met before? I don't think I know you.
DIALOG | Ludwig | I... that's unfortunate to hear. I was really hoping you'd remember me.
DIALOG | P_NAME | What?
DIALOG | Ludwig | Nevermind.

LUDWIG2
DIALOG | Ludwig | Hello...
DIALOG | P_NAME | So have we met before?
DIALOG | Ludwig | Does it matter? It's probably clear by now that we aren't capable of having a meaningful conversation.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSad | Um, I guess so.

LUDWIG3
DIALOG | Ludwig | I'm pretty sure I've never seen you before. It's not like we were good friends and I forgot or anything. I don't really know what I am, but I know I wouldn't do that.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | Yeah that's what I was saying! We had never met before!

LUDWIG4
DIALOG | Ludwig | Hello, nice to meet you.
DIALOG | P_NAME | We just met!
DIALOG | Ludwig | I... No, you're just trying to trick me.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Why would I trick you?
DIALOG | Ludwig | I'm an Eintag Dwarf. I'm very valuable. Supposedly, anyway... I don't know if that's still the case...
DIALOG | P_NAME | What does that mean?
DIALOG | Ludwig | I'm not sure how to say this. You're the only person I've ever spoken to...
DIALOG | P_NAME | I don't really understand.
DIALOG | Ludwig | It's difficult to describe, but, I'm an Eintag Dwarf. We have many traits, most of which we aren't aware of until we're a little older...or is it younger? If we even get that far.
DIALOG | P_NAME | What does this mean?
DIALOG | Ludwig | Most of us just pass by the people to whom we belong. Only if we're really lucky we can establish some sort of bond with someone.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | Oh! So that's me? I can help you?
DIALOG | Ludwig | I don't know if you can help me. Eintag Dwarfs have a different perception of spatial reality than others, even other Dwarfs. We're born knowing quite a few things, but aren't always on the proper spatial trajectory to do anything about it. Most of us just fade away.
DIALOG | P_NAME | How can I help you, then? We're friends!
DIALOG | Ludwig = s_port_ludwig_happy | Really?
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | Definitely!
DIALOG | Ludwig | Thanks... I'm not sure if our lives share the same trajectory. The things you've said to me thus far suggest this. You may not be able to help me, even if you want to.
DIALOG | P_NAME | What do I need to do?
DIALOG | Ludwig | Ask me to come with you.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Where?
DIALOG | Ludwig | Anywhere. Away. Not here. I'll die if I stay here.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Okay then...

DIALOG | P_NAME | Anywhere. Away. Not here. You told me this is what you wanted.

LUDWIG7
DIALOG | Ludwig = s_port_ludwig_happy | Hi, I'm Ludwig! I was just born.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSad | You... You don't remember me at all?
DIALOG | Ludwig = s_port_ludwig_happy | How can I remember you when I was just born?
DIALOG | P_NAME | We were just talking. You told me to ask you to come with me.
DIALOG | Ludwig = s_port_ludwig_happy | I'm pretty sure I didn't do that! I was just born this very minute!
DIALOG | Ludwig = s_port_ludwig_happy | It's pretty exciting to be alive. I know a lot of things. I'm just starting to be aware of it all.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Isn't there anything I can do to make you come with me?
DIALOG | Ludwig = s_port_ludwig_happy | What? That's a curious thing to say.
