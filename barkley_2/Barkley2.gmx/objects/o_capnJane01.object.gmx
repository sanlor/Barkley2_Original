DIALOG | P_NAME     | Wow, you're an amazing accordion player! What's that song called?
DIALOG | Cap'n Jane | Arrrr, leave me to me accordion, landlubber. I'm in no mood to hear your tiresome squawking.
DIALOG | P_NAME     | Huh, what's the matter?
DIALOG | Cap'n Jane | It's been a hard few months, landlubber. I was cap'n of the Cursed Corsair, the crustiest, scurviest group'a pirates you ever laid eyes on. We'd raid the coast, aplunderin' booty and dubloons from anyone who crossed our paths - didn't matter who! Well, one day our deeds caught up to us and we were forced to make a choice - walk the plank or go legit. So whattaya think I chose, landlubber? 'course I chose goin' legit. I even threw away me ol' pegleg... didn't need it, but it looked good on me resume. Well, long story short, Al-Akihabara ain't the best of shrimping towns.
DIALOG | P_NAME     | Shrimping? Out here? But there's no water at all!
DIALOG | Cap'n Jane | Arrrr, it was an unwise business decision. Now leave me alone! I'm in a bad mood and I want to play me accordion! And where's that blasted bartender?

RECRUIT_YAY
DIALOG | P_NAME     | Y'know, Cap'n Jane, you're pretty good at that accordion. I'm putting together a band for a wedding. You could join if you're looking for some work.
DIALOG | Cap'n Jane | Hmmm, a wedding band, eh? That doesn't sound too lucrative... but I'm stuck out here eatin' hardtack'n lemons. Alright, landlubber... I'll budge. What do I haveta do?
DIALOG | P_NAME     | I'm still putting the band together, but I'll be ready soon. If you want to go to the booty bass club in Brain City, I'll meet you there when everything's set.

DIALOG | Cap'n Jane | You gettin' sandsick, kiddo? I'll never part with me ol' bandoneon. It's one of the few things that keeps me goin' when I get lonely out here. Some nights when the winds are really blowin' over the top of these here dunes, I lay on me back, squeeze these here bellows, and sing a quiet sea shanty... it's almost like I'm on the sea again...
DIALOG | P_NAME     | Wow... that's really sweet Cap'n Jane. I never knew pirates could be so sensitive. You should keep playing your accordion, no matter what anyone says.
DIALOG | Cap'n Jane | Sensitive!? Mark my words, I'll send ya to a sandy grave if I ever hear ya saying something like that again. I swear it on the sea!
DIALOG | P_NAME     | Whoa! Sorry, Cap'n, I didn't mean it...
DIALOG | Cap'n Jane | Aye, ye are forgiven... but don't let it happen again! And get me a drink while you're at it!
