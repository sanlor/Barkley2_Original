DIALOG | P_NAME  | Oh, I uh... this is just, I mean... there was a party and I got `kw`ketchup`rt` all over myself and...
DIALOG | Dracula | `w1`Ha ha ha.`w0` You do not haff to tell lie. I have nose for blood. I know that not ketchup.
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Look, I didn't do anything wrong. I don't really even know what happened. That guy just... exploded.
DIALOG | Dracula | `w1`Ha ha ha.`w0` Do not vorry, sport. I am friend. Yes. I am `sq`Dracula.`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME  | So... you aren't gonna tell the police about me? Wait a minute... Dracula? I've heard that name before, I think.
DIALOG | Dracula | Many people heard about Dracula. but nobody knov the truth. I think people... they not vant to knov the truth. They like be afraid. No, not afraid. They vant someone they can hate.
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Are you saying the people here don't like you? You seem like a nice guy mister Dracula. Certainly a lot nicer than most people I've met.
DIALOG | Dracula | Thank you. That vas very nice thing to say. Yes, I do not vish to be, uh... how you say... evil, I think, but... I must. The peoples, they alvays hated me, alvays afraid of me. But durink my lifetime I haff understand that if I am evil, it is because it is necessary. I am, hov do you say... `kw`a necessary evil.`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME  | Huh?
DIALOG | Dracula | `w1`Ha ha ha.`w0` You are young. Vhen you grov, you vill understand. At beginnink, the peoples hate me and I hate them too. But then I learn, vhen they hate, vhen they afraid, that is vhen they be tokether. That is vhen the love each other. I have lived long time, and I have died many time. Vhen they think I vas kaput, they forget Dracula, and they stop hate. Vhen they stop hate, and not afraid, then they stop love each other. I haff become to understand. `kw`Ve all haff role to play.`rt` Like theatre. Haff you been to theatre?
DIALOG | P_NAME  | I don't know. I don't really remember all that much. I think... I think I once saw `kw`Peter Pan`rt` in a theatre.
DIALOG | Dracula | Ah! `kw`Piotr!`rt` He goot friend. He knov vhat role he is. Yes. `w1`Ha ha ha.`w0` Goot ol' Piotr. But... it been very long time vhen I see Piotr. `w1`*Sniff*`w0`
DIALOG | P_NAME  | M-mister Dracula... are you crying?
DIALOG | Dracula | Yes, a little. I miss my friend, Piotr. Vher I kome, man do not kry. If you kry, you not a man. That vhat they say. But all the man... they have pain in heart. They vant kry, but kan not. It is not alloved. But... I kry. I do not kare. Vhat to you think? Do you kry?
DIALOG | P_NAME  | I uh... well... when I was little I probably cried but...
DIALOG | Dracula | `w1`Ha ha ha.`w0` I see. It okay. I do not kry vhen others see... I try to not shov it. If they see me kry, they think I veak. Then, they not afraid, and not hate so much. Then, they stop being together. If someone see Dracula kry then Dracula must kill, and `s1`drink the blood!`s0` Then `s1`THEY`s0` will kry, not Dracula!
DIALOG | P_NAME  | `w1`*Gulp*`w0` Look, I didn't see anything, okay? I mean, you weren't crying I was just imagining it and-
DIALOG | Dracula | `w1`Ha ha ha.`w0` Do not vorry. I tell you. I am friend. I am Dracula. I do not drink you blood. You are like me. You play the role too. You also like blood. But you not drink blood, you shover in blood. Very strange, but I think it probably fun, yes? `w1`Ha ha ha.`w0` I must try it too. Vell, anyvays, I must be going nov. Maype ve vill meet again.
