DIALOG | The Nose Kid | Yes, this is the fabled, one and only Purple Oak Dojo.

DIALOG | P_NAME       | Have you ever heard of the Cyberdwarf?
DIALOG | The Nose Kid | The Cyberdwarf?_ Oh, yeah! I've heard about him.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | You have?!
DIALOG | The Nose Kid | Yeah. I read about him on DwarfNET. He is like the leader of some rebel group somewhere south of the wall. Sounds pretty dangerous to be honest.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Oh... So he isn't here then?
DIALOG | The Nose Kid | Hah, no way. It's just us monks out here.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Heck...
GOTO   | ASKING

DOJO_DOJO
DIALOG | P_NAME       | What is this place?
DIALOG | The Nose Kid | This is the Spinning Jalapeno Dojo. You didn't know that?

DIALOG | P_NAME       | I don't much about anything. I have amnesia.
DIALOG | The Nose Kid | Whoa, that's messed up. It's a good thing you found your way here. There's nothing a little meditation and fresh air won't fix.
GOTO   | ASKING

DOJO_WHO
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Who are you guys?
DIALOG | The Nose Kid | Huh? We are monks of the Order of the Bent Crane. We live here, on the north side of the wall, strengthening our fortitude and practicing our secret jutsu so that we'll be ready for the final war.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Oh, uh, sounds... interesting.
DIALOG | The Nose Kid | Over there is The Hiya Kid.

DIALOG | The Nose Kid | He's my best friend._ Long time ago his parent's plane crashed near this dojo. It was a scene of total hell carnage but fortunately the monks found The Hiya Kid amongst the debris and were able to nurture him back to health.
DIALOG | P_NAME       | Wow, that's amazing!
DIALOG | The Nose Kid | Heh, you got that right. Ever since then he's lived here with us, trying his hardest to blend in.
