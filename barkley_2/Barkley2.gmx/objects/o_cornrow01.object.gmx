DIALOG | Cornrow | Well if it ain't the new governor! Pleased to meet you, sir! I'm Cornrow, this is my associate Juicebox, and as you can see we're just uh, volunteering. Keeping kids off the streets, teachin' 'em to read, the whole nine yards.

DIALOG | P_NAME | Oh... I'm kinda new here.
DIALOG | Cornrow | Ha! You're tellin' me, kid!!
DIALOG | Juicebox | You're tellin' him.
DIALOG | Cornrow | Lemme tell ya', the alleys of Tir na nOg aren't a good place for kids like you to wander around alone. You never know what kinda creeps are out here. Duergars, Bainshees, all kindsa goons lookin' to rob ya blind. Ha! I bet you don't even got a dime on ya!
DIALOG | P_NAME | Well, Mr. Wilmer only gave me l_i_t_t_l_e_m_o_n_e_y_.
DIALOG | Cornrow | Now THAT is a shame, kid. That's a DAMN shame. Ya know, you're lucky you ran into me and my, uh, nephew Juicebox. See, me and Juicebox, we're like the guardian angels of Tir na nOg - we're the good guys, y'know? Nothin' makes us feel better than seein' a new guy like you land on his feet out here. Now me and Juicebox, we got a proposition for ya -
DIALOG | Juicebox | A /;proposition/'.
DIALOG | Cornrow | That's right, a proposition. What do you say me and Juicebox show you the ropes around here, fill you in on what's what on the streets and make a little scratch in the process, eh? You don't gotta do nothin' but run a few errands for us and it'll only take a moment of your time. How's that sound, kid?

DIALOG | Juicebox | You were right, Cornrow.
DIALOG | Cornrow | Now listen up, kid. This is real simple. Me and Juicebox were gonna distribute a buncha fruits to malnourished children but I left my fruit basket at my granny's house. Alls ya gotta do is head over to granny's house and pick up the big ol' basket of fruit, real big, like one of them, uh, whattaya call em - cornucopias? - and bring it back. That's it.
DIALOG | Juicebox | That's it.
DIALOG | Cornrow | I'd do it myself but I'm uh, busy teaching impoverished children how to read.
DIALOG | Juicebox | Uncle Cornrow's teachin' me how to do letters.
DIALOG | P_NAME | This doesn't sound too hard. Where does granny live?

DIALOG | P_NAME | Hey um, Mr. Cornrow? Can you tell me how to find your granny again?
DIALOG | Cornrow | Heh heh, you bet, kid. She's normally at church with that numnutz Giuseppe. And make sure she doesn't know you've got her medicine, otherwise she'll get all fussy.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Yeah, I understand. I'll be right back!
