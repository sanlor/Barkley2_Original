DIALOG | Lt. Florian  | Oh yeah that old thing? Yeah I was told it's a KOSMIChumanator... but I don't know how to use it._ Do you?
IF knowHumanator == 1 | REPLY | P_NAME | No not really, but I am collecting them.
IF knowHumanator &gt;= 2 | REPLY | P_NAME | Yep, I got a guy in Brain City that can utilize them.

DIALOG | Lt. Florian | Oh `sq`that's a KOSMIChumantor.`rt` I've never really used it before, but I'm supposed to keep it ready just in case some_ `w1`wayward braster`w0` needs some `sq`humanism modifications.`rt`
DIALOG | P_NAME      | What are those?
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | Well that's kinda a good question, I don't really know. It's got a lot to do with how much of your body is a certain `sq`elemental affinity.`rt` It's like_ being more attuned to certain types of interactions in the world... 
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | But sadly I'm not the guy to ask. I'm not a transhumanist, I'm just a medic. `sq`But I've heard that there is a real transhumanist somewhere in the recesses of Brain City.`rt`
KNOW   | knowDrBlakemore | 1
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Hmmm, interesting.
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | Anyways, it's kind of valuable and since I can't really use it, maybe I should trade it for something.
IF @Busted Ass Tuba@ &gt;= 1 | GOTO | TUBACHOICE
DIALOG | P_NAME      | If I find anything I'll let you know!
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | Thanks! Anything else?
GOTO   | FLORIANCHOICE

PRISONADVICE
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Uh, Lafayette said I should go to The Hoosegow and liberate the dwarfs. Got any advice?
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | Apart from not going to prison?
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Yeah.
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | The second best advice I could give is `sq`talking to Compson.`rt` He's an old crumudgeon with a deeply cynical suicidal urge but he's a `w1`soldier with a heart of go-`w1`_ well,_ I'm pretty sure he still has his heart. I'm a doctor, I should know these things.

DUERGARINFO
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Do you know anything about those Duergars out there?
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | They're all over. They're the biggest threat to our safety. Most of the dwarfs I bot- er, `w1`stitch up`w0` are because of them.
DIALOG | P_NAME      | No, I mean the camp nearby. There's a outpost real close by.
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | What? Nearby? Are you sure?
IF knowDuergarCamp == 1 | DIALOG | P_NAME | Lafayette seems to think so.
IF knowDuergarCamp == 2 | DIALOG | P_NAME | Yep, I've seen it myself.
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | That must be where all those explosions are coming from... We have to do something about this. Do you have any ideas?
DIALOG | P_NAME      | I don't know. `sq`I'm afraid I may have to_ `s1`merc them.`s0``rt`
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | Maybe you can just convince them to go away. If they haven't shown up here already they might not know we're here.
DIALOG | P_NAME      | I'll give it the ole_ `w1`college try.`w0`

REBELINFO01
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Got any new rebel info for me?

REBELINFO00
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Anything interesting going on with the rebels right now?
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | I don't know. I just stay here, I really don't know anything about that. Just... Just don't tell anybody this, but I don't think it's going good. We don't hear from HQ anymore.  The carrier rats have stopped coming by and supplies have dried up. It's like they forgot about us. Don't tell Lafayette. I make stuff up sometimes to make him feel better. He still thinks we have a chance.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSad | Ok. I won't say anything...

QUITTHEPRACTICE
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Why don't you quit being a doctor if you hate it so much?
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | I don't know. I don't have anything else to do since I sold my tuba. Never learned how to do anything else. Every once in a while I get to save somebody too, but I'm barely getting by. But don't worry, if you get hurt I'll try really hard to keep you alive. I'm not really the best at this, but I work hard. That's something I guess. I don't know....

DOCTORINFO
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Are you sure you're a real doctor?
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | I don't know. Kinda.
DIALOG | P_NAME      | You just don't seem to like it very much.
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | No, I don't. Well... I don't know. It took me months to get my license. 
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | I get lightheaded when I see blood and I can't read either. I had to learn all this medical stuff by looking at pictures.
WAIT   | 0.5
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzHappy | Wow, I think that's kinda impressive. Just from looking at the pictures?
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | Yeah. But being a doctor isn't as cool as it looks on the tube.
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | I had to learn that the hard way._ There's nothing worse than losing a patient..._ Nothing worse than that.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSad | I guess you're right.
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | Anyway, anything else for me?

NOTHING
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Just thought I'd see how you're doing.
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | Oh... well, I'm doing fine. Thanks for asking._ Don't get sick.

FLORIAN00
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | You aren't uh..._ sick, are you?
DIALOG | P_NAME      | I'm a little banged up, but I'll survive. That's common for a braster like me, I guess. Why? Are you a doctor?
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | I'm the base medic, but I'm not really good at it. Honestly I'm a little relieved you don't need any medical attention. I've had a bad string of, er_ `w1`botch jobs`w0` recently.
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzAngry | That's not good. Not good at all. 
DIALOG | Lt. Florian | Thank you! Good! I was afraid I'd need to operate again. I'm really bad at operations. Operations are really the worst thing I've ever experienced. I hope you never have to operate on somebody. Anyways, I can I help you with anything?

DIALOG | Lt. Florian | Really? You mean it?!
DIALOG | P_NAME      | Yeah of course. I'm more into @quest_faveMusic@ than toots on a Tuba. Plus I could use that `sq`KOSMIChumanator`rt` a lot more than an ole sousaphone.
