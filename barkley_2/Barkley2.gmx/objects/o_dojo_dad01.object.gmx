DIALOG | P_NAME   | Dude._ What are you wearing?
DIALOG | Dojo Dad | Ah, this robe I wear? It is called a `w1``kw`/'Kimono/'`rt``w0` and it is highly revered and respected in this culture. I'm simply showing my appreciation to the simple folk who live here in these harsh conditions.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | There's a lot of flowers and stuff on it. Kinda... girly. But then... What about your hair?
DIALOG | Dojo Dad | My hair? Oh, you mean these accessories? They are just some chopsticks one of these filthy peasants gave me.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Why are they on your head?
DIALOG | Dojo Dad | Ah, well, I think this is the sort of hairdo that's all the hottest rage around these parts. I mean, the advertisement for this place had some pictures of people with this sort of hair.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Uh, nary ye mind. So where'd you get that kimono anyway?
DIALOG | Dojo Dad | One of the simpletons here spent many a day and night to forge it from the finest of silks and sorghum. He did not simply give it to me though, I had to earn it. I meditated with the grandmaster many a time before he was willing to sell this kimono to me.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Oh, so you just bought it?
DIALOG | Dojo Dad | Uh, well, I suppose you could say that, but that would be a bit misleading.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | I have to say, it does look comfortable. Do you think I would be able to get one? I mean, one with something besides flowers on it.
DIALOG | Dojo Dad | This kimono is a one of a kind, my friend. It was handmade just for me. You surely can't have `w1`one as fine as this...`w0` But yes, I have seen some other kimono's around here. The ones with pictures of anime characters really caught my eye.
