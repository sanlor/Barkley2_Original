DIALOG | P_NAME        | Yes, that's right.
DIALOG | Master Miller | Get rid of Dojo Dad for me, and I'll gladly apologize and reconsider my views about outsiders.
DIALOG | P_NAME        | What? How am I supposed to do that?
DIALOG | Master Miller | Hah! Don't ask me. You wanted to prove your worth, well here's your chance.
DIALOG | P_NAME        | But...
DIALOG | Master Miller | I knew it. You didn't really mean it when you said that you wanted to help.
DIALOG | P_NAME        | No, that's not it. I just... I mean, throw me a bone here. Do you have any ideas on how to do this?
DIALOG | Master Miller | I suppose it's in the dojo's best interest for me to help you. You could try and beat him up and then I'll take care of the rest.
DIALOG | P_NAME        | What? No way, granny. I'm not gonna beat someone up just to make them leave.
DIALOG | Master Miller | Beating him up would be my first choice.
DIALOG | P_NAME        | Come on, there's gotta be something else I can do.
DIALOG | Master Miller | You could just kick him in the nards and then he'd be easy pickings for my men to carry out.
DIALOG | P_NAME        | Why don't you just do that on your own then?
DIALOG | Master Miller | Me? I'm just a decrepit old lady. I wouldn't be able to lift my leg to his nard level, let alone kick him. Besides, the monks of this dojo are strictly forbidden from starting a fight. Only after a fight has broken out are they allowed to join in on the fun.
DIALOG | P_NAME        | Alright, so go for the nards. Any other ideas?
DIALOG | Master Miller | He said that he is from the city of Triskelion. Maybe someone there knows something about him that we don't.

DIALOG | P_NAME        | I'm telling you to chill out. You are taking this whole Dojo Dad business way too personal.
DIALOG | Master Miller | Oh, so you think I should just back off, eh? Just forget about him dishonoring our dojo day in and day out?
DIALOG | P_NAME        | All I'm saying is that you gotta step back, and take a breath through your nostrils.
DIALOG | Master Miller | Don't give me that shit. I have to spend every waking moment looking at that son of a bitch stinking up the place.
DIALOG | P_NAME        | Can't you just tell him to pack his bags and leave?
DIALOG | Master Miller | Hah! Fat chance, gaijin. That turd is here to stay, and as long as his pockets are loaded with shekels Master Stevesamasanchan Senpai will approve. There's nothing I can do.

DIALOG | P_NAME        | Grandmaster, huh? What does that mean?
DIALOG | Master Miller | It means that he challenged our previous grandmaster, `kw`Naruto,`rt` to a fight to the death and won. 
DIALOG | Master Miller | It was total bloody hell carnage but Stevesamasanchan won with a `kw`decisive head decapitation jutsu`rt` known as the `sq`/'Requiem of the Neck/'.`rt` 
DIALOG | Master Miller | Ever since then Stevesamasanchan has been calling the shots around here, and what he loves most about this whole dojo business... is profit.
DIALOG | P_NAME        | Whoa! That fight must've been epic!
DIALOG | Master Miller | That's one way to put it. 
DIALOG | Master Miller | Thanks to Stevesamasanchan we now have to put up with that son of a bitch Dojo Dad. Master promised to lead Dojo Dad to enlightenment and he slurped up the bait, hook, line and sinker.
