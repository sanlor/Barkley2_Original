DIALOG | Stonewall /'Booty Daimyo/' Jackson   | Unbelievable! You guys were amazing on that stage! Did you see me shakin' my glutes out there? The Jazzy Rascals, man!
IF polyWedding == 1      | DIALOG | Poly      | Man, that was killer! You see those people rockin' out there? The Jazzy Rascals fuckin' rule!
IF guillaumeWedding == 1 | DIALOG | Guillaume | Maaaan, the vibes I was gettin' out there... all of us in sync, cosmic harmony, y'know? I could really feel the energy, man.
IF wayneWedding == 1     | DIALOG | Wayne     | ...we rocked.
IF garciaWedding == 1    | DIALOG | Garcia    | Y-yeah, that went pretty well, guys. Haven't had a gig like that since... man... you think we're gonna get a Wikipedia page?
IF janeWedding == 1 | IF zalmoxisWedding == 1 | DIALOG | Cap'n Jane | Arrr... the Jazzy Rascals weren't so bad after all. Not even that weird honking thing Zalmoxis played.
IF janeWedding == 1 | IF zalmoxisWedding == 0 | DIALOG | Cap'n Jane | Arrr... the Jazzy Rascals weren't so bad after all.
IF dinahWedding == 1     | DIALOG | Dinah     | I was kinda nervous at first but once we got up there and really started goin' at it, my butterflies completely went away. That was awesome!
IF zalmoxisWedding == 1  | DIALOG | Zalmoxis  | I am... surprised at how well that went. The Jazzy Rascals were `w1`far`w0` more competent than I had presumed.
√çF borisWedding == 1     | DIALOG | Boris     | T'was quite enjoyable to toot with fellows so genial! I hope indeed we have the opportunity to play again.

IF bootyBassQuest == 3   | DIALOG | Stonewall /'Booty Daimyo/' Jackson | P_NAME, you're the total package! You can spin the vinyl, you've got an eye for talent and you've got some real singing chops. You were made for show business - you're gonna go places, kid! You really are the jazziest of rascals! That's a great name, by the way. You picked a good one!
IF bootyBassQuest != 3   | DIALOG | Stonewall /'Booty Daimyo/' Jackson | And P_NAME, you really stole the show with those pipes of yours out there. You've got an eye for talent and you've got some real singing chops. You were made for show business - you're gonna go places, kid! You really are the jazziest of rascals! That's a great name, by the way. You picked a good one!
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzAngry | (I hate that name... can we please stop saying it...)
DIALOG | Stonewall /'Booty Daimyo/' Jackson | So hey, we really hit the jackpot on this one, rascals. 30,000 neuro-shekels, can you believe it? GatDAM, that's the kinda money that makes wanna go full-time in the management biz. So that's 5,000 for me, 25,000 for the rest of you. Split five ways, that's 5k a piece.
QUEST  | money += 5000
NOTIFY | Found 5,000 neuro-shekels!
DIALOG | Stonewall /'Booty Daimyo/' Jackson | So I've got just one question for you all - what's next for The Jazzy Rascals?

IF dinahWedding == 1     | DIALOG | Dinah      | Huh, I guess I'm gonna get some new gear and start working on an album or something. Maybe a Jazzy Rascals remix?
IF wayneWedding == 1     | DIALOG | Wayne      | ...goin' back to my cave.
IF janeWedding == 1      | DIALOG | Cap'n Jane | You should join me crew, Wayne. We could always use another hand on the ship and the fresh air would do ya good!
IF janeWedding == 1      | DIALOG | Wayne      | ...no thanks.
