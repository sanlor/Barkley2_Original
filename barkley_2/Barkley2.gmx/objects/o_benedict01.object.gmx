GOVERNOR
DIALOG | Benedict | Well if it ain't the new governor. I guess yer a real bigshot, huh? Well you'd be doin' me a big favor if you made the sewers a little safer to fish in. And let Cuchulainn know we're all ready for that prize.

MEETINSEWERS
DIALOG | Benedict | Just takin' my time down here in the sewers. Listin' to the machines of public works and driftin' off to sleep from time to time. Say hey, you wouldn't be interested in a fishin' pole would you? @money_benedictPole@ neuro-shekels?

Or if there is a path through the sewers to where the `mq`L.O.N.G.I.N.U.S. rebels`rt` hide out? Or if there really is a `kw`plantation`rt` run by a grotesque Duergar who barbarously forces slaves to farm for sewer treats? But I guess you don't know either.

DIALOG | Benedict | Hey, buddy. Just slowly making my way to the ol' fishing spot. Hoping to catch a nice meal for myself. Know how they are bitin' this mornin'?
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | Don't go fishin' down there! Turald tried to catch a lunker and ended up getting sucked into the sewer sludge! He's fish bait by now!

SURPRISEAT | o_benedict01
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzSurprise | What in the zooks do you mean?!
DIALOG | Benedict | SGICSO... The Sombrero Galaxy Introductory Charter School for Orphans... Thirty short years ago... I walk to my seat in the cafeteria, where I always sit, where I always minded my own business. I look down... a Choco-mallow on the ground, perfect in everyway. /'How lucky could one orphan be?/' I thought to myself. I reach down to pick up my new prize and... the mallow MOVES ON IT'S OWN. I drop my tray of /'Grapes Melange/' and dive for the mallow, it bounces away from my grasp._ I fall to the dirty floor of the orphanage as the other orphans erupt in laughter! Their cruel chuckles stin' and cut like pirahna bites. A third time I reach for the mallow, it just beyond my chubby orphan fin'ers. But this time I see somethin', a hook... a hook protrudin' from the confection, a ubiquitous monofilament line is fastened securely to it. I follow the clear line with my eyes, for even in my orphan days I am a skilled angler, and can make out the barely visible signature of 10-stone test line from even the free throw line. The cord stretches from the mallow down and alongside the crowded cafeteria benches. The benches brim and roil with riant orphan hecklers, churnin' in the merriment of schadenfreude. I am a laughin'stock. And that is when I see him... at the opposite end of the line from my would-be prize. Turald, that rat-bastard, he wears a grin as wide as his bullshit face would allow. He always was the alpha orphan... and he is makin' painfully clear with this sadistic prank. Through the tears wellin' up and overflowin' onto my rosy orphan cheeks I see Turald saunter over to me, standin' on the same dirty floor that I could not sink low enough into... he leans down to me, the smirk I so desperately loathe mere inches from my ear... he says...

DIALOG | Benedict | Well guess what motherfucker?! I couldn't agree more! Bwahahahahahah!
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzShock | Mercy be to the Holy See! What have you done?
DIALOG | Benedict | I did nothin'! It was Turald's own haughtiness that led to his demise! I merely waited long enough to see it happen! Bwahahahahahah!

DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzAngry | You shouldn't be so happy about someone else's death... all lives are precious... I think....
DIALOG | Benedict | When you live with pain for long enough, when you have been told that your life is exactly NOT precious... that is when you laugh in the face of death!
DIALOG | P_NAME = s_port_hoopzAngry | ...
DIALOG | Benedict | Well, I don't think I'll be needin' this fishin' pole anymore... I've been sittin' around waitin' for this moment for so long, walkin' down to this spot everyday just to listen for that big splash of Turald hittin' the water. You take it.
DIALOG | P_NAME   | Take your fishing pole?
DIALOG | Benedict | Yeah go for it, take it. My gift, I won't need it. I won't need this lure either so you can have that as well. I'm just goin' to sit here for a while longer just wrap my head around everythin'..._ stay strong, P_NAME_S.
