DIALOG | WIZARD | BLASPHEMOUS SONIC LIBATIONS UNTO THE ETERNAL ANATHEMATIZER. ZENITHAL PRAISES TO THE LIGHT BRINGER, WHOSE ORGIASTIC CREED OF SIN SPATES THE COSMOS IN UNREMITTING VICE.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Are you talking about Clispaeth? Are you a bassist for the Big Guy?
DIALOG | WIZARD | DEBASE YOURSELF IN PROPITIATION TO THE MORNING STAR, WHOSE ALMIGHTY LIGHT BATHES US IN FORBIDDEN WISDOM. THE SERPENT ALONE GUIDES MY DISCORDANT THRENODY.
DIALOG | P_NAME | O-ooooh... that's what I figured... (I still don't know what this guy is talking about...)
DIALOG | WIZARD | GO NOW. PROLIFERATE MY CRUSHING DIRGE TO THE ILLITERATE MASSES, SHACKLED IN THE IGNORANCE OF THEIR HYPOCRITICAL DOGMA AND ITS FALSE PROPHETS. /LEVIATHAN./ /IST./ /KRIEG./

REPLY  | RECRUIT_NAY | Nah, I don't think the band needs a bass.

RECRUIT_YAY
DIALOG | P_NAME | Hey WIZARD, you're pretty sick with that bass. It's, er... very /'kvlt/'. I'm trying to put together a band to play at... uh, a wedding... I don't know if that's your thing or not...
DIALOG | WIZARD | IF YOU ARE GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPREAD MY MASTER'S TRITONES, THEN I WILL OBLIGE. TELL ME WHERE TO GO.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Wh-whoa... that was easy. Okay, yeah, I'm still putting the band together but if you go to the booty bass club in Brain City, I'll be there when I'm ready.

BETRAYAL
DIALOG | WIZARD | I AWAITED YOUR ARRIVAL IN THE TEMPLE OF LIES FOR NAUGHT. YOU DECEIVED ME, TREACHEROUS KNAVE.
