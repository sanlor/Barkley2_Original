OZANNE_0
DIALOG | Ozanne | Welcome to the Brain City Library. Computer sign-ups are over there.
DIALOG | P_NAME | The library, huh? So I can check out any of these?
DIALOG | Ozanne | That's right. We've got some great collections in here. Is there anything in particular you are looking for? Any genre you are fond of?

LOOK_FANTASY
DIALOG | P_NAME | I want to read some fantasy books. Like... knights and magick spells and stuff like that.
DIALOG | Ozanne | Ah, I see. Yes, we have a nice collection of Orc books down in the back. They are right in the back there on the Orc section.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Alright, thanks a lot!

LOOK_INFO 
DIALOG | P_NAME | I want to read some informative books. I want to be filled with information because information is power, and I need more power.
DIALOG | Ozanne | Hmm. I suppose all these books hold lots of information but what you seem to be looking for in particular can be found in our Infodump section right over there.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Alright, thanks. I'll check it out.

LOOK_LORE 
DIALOG | P_NAME | I want some lore on me. I want to read some nice, juicy item descriptions. Who was the king's uncle, and why did he build the bridge? I need to impress my fellow gamers on the forums.
DIALOG | Ozanne | Item descriptions, huh? Hmm... Yes... Yes, I think what you are looking for is in the Item Descriptions section.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Alright, thanks!

LOOK_SELFHELP 
DIALOG | P_NAME | I think the only person I can trust is yours truly. So I think what I need is some self-help books to boost my knowledge. 
DIALOG | Ozanne | Hmm... That's a tough one. We don't really have self-help books, or anything that really comes even close.
DIALOG | P_NAME | W-what...?
DIALOG | Ozanne | Sorry, I guess you are out of luck on this one.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Aww shucks...

LOOK_TRAVEL 
DIALOG | P_NAME | I think I would like to take a nice vacation, but first I need to learn about some potential traveling destinations.
DIALOG | Ozanne | Uh, I don't think we have anything about traveling, unless it's within Necron 7's borders. Sorry.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Aww, crud...

LOOK_GAME
DIALOG | P_NAME | I want to dive deep into some game reviews. Whacha got for me?
DIALOG | Ozanne | Game reviews? Uh... I don't think we have any. Sorry.
DIALOG | P_NAME | W-what? N-no...
DIALOG | Ozanne | Yeah, sorry. I think you might want to try DwarfNET for that sort of a thing.

LOOK_DETECTIVE
DIALOG | P_NAME | I want to read some spooky detective stories. Criminals and robber barons dueling in the heart of the city with only one man able to stop them.
DIALOG | Ozanne | Hmm... No, sorry. We don't have those.
DIALOG | P_NAME | Darn...

LOOK_NOTHING
DIALOG | P_NAME | Nary ye mind...
