to him or not, trying to talk to Abdul-Gafur when he has Duergars in front of
him will get him kicked out of his store, and you kicked out of Tir na Nog.
If it's your first time talking to them during Time 3, Hoopz will
make a remark about the duergars being in the way, and the loud music.
The player is chided by Abdul-Gafur and the Duergar variable increases by 1.

/* If it's your second time talking to them during Time 3, Hoopz will
be... kicked out of Tir na Nog? Shoved into a building maybe? Who knows...
