/*
Sgt Variable's TWO Different Cutscenes during the main quest

1 - 
This is the collision event that starts the "Elevator Borking Scene" - Variable will bork the elevator and then run 
off distracting Rosencrantz and Guildenstern enough to have Hoopz run into the elevator. 

2 -
A short scene where Variable borks the "AI Ruins Scanner" so that you can gain access.

Animations:
"kneeling"
"bubbleChew"
"brandish"
ANIMATION_DOWN
"runMachete" - not a native move animation, must be faked in

Variable's Variables:

variableState = 1 - not used yet

elevatorBork = 1 - after this scene, this variable will keep it from happening again

airScannerBork = 1 - after this scene, this will keep variable from borking the scanner anymore

wiglafMission = 2 - this checks to make sure that you should be there ... Variable won't show up if this isn't 2

r&gEncounter == 0 - somehow avoided R&G
r&gEncounter == 1 - fought and died against R&G
r&gEncounter == 2 - killed R&G
