This will eventually go into the Chatroulette Mechanic that we will be building,
for now, this is how Cdwarf talks to you and will work much like the Junk Lord 
in that he is turned on to run at certain stages of the game (mainly quest variables).

Variables:
chatrouletteState
    0 = never run chat roulette
    1 = have run it and spoken to Cyberdwarf the first time

csQuest
    0 = Have not started quest
    1 = Discussed the AI Ruins Hoopz has started his journey there
    2 = Hoopz talks to cdwarf after turning on the Wifi. Cyberdwarf and is compelled to descend into the ruins
    3 = Cyberdwarf repeating dialogue
    4 = Hoopz finds the Cyberspear altar empty
    5 = Cyberdwarf asks him to descend further into the ruins
    6 = Cyberdwarf repeating dialogue
    7 = Hoopz has found the first piece
    8 = Hoopz talks to Cyberdwarf and is on a quest to find the remaining 3 pieces
    9 = repeating dialogue. (this will be tracked by csPiecesTotal)
   10 = Hoopz has all 4 pieces
   11 = Hoopz has been told to go back to Cyberdwarf to assemble the pieces
   12 = Repeating dialogue

csPieceFactory
    0 = Hoopz has not seen the Factory Piece
    1 = Hoopz seen the Factory Piece
    2 = Hoopz now realizes that the Factory Piece is a CS Piece and agrees to go get it
    3 = Cyberdwarf filler dialogue
    4 = Cyberdwarf looping dialogue
    5 = Hoopz has the piece

csPieceGrem
    0 = Hoopz has not completed the cybergremlin quest
    1 = Hoopz has completed the cybergremlin quest
    2 = Hoopz now realizes that the Clispeathian relic is a CS Piece, Cdwarf has told him to go retrieve it
    3 = Cyberdwarf filler dialogue
    4 = Cyberdwarf repeating dialogue
    5 = Hoopz has the piece

csDaisSeen
