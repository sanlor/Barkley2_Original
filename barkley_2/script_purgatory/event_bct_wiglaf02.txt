wiglafMission = 1 - You've been assigned to kill Cuchulainn in order to meet Cyberdwarf.
wiglafMission = 2 - You've exited the rebel base through the hatch the Jhodfrey shows you.
wiglafMission = 3 - You've made it passed the Variable Segment and are now entering Cuchu's lair
wiglafMission = 4 - You've reported back to Wiglaf to complain and get full permission to meet Cyberdwarf.

crustFightAny = 1 - You've fought Cuchu Crustacea.
cuchuLairDeath = 1 - you died in cuchu's lair
