// TRIAL 1:
CHANGES:
	Cybergremlins have 90 Armor
	Bloating and Consuming removed
	Gun's named
	Gun points reduced from 300,130,300,130 to 100,75,100,80
NOTES:
	Bullet Amounts:
		Pistol: 99
		SG: 30
		SMG: 258
		Rifle: 40
		
	Shotgun and SMG do 0 damage to Cybergremlins
	Rifle and Pistol do 2 - 5. 5 shots to kill them still.

// TRIAL 2:
CHANGES:
	Cybergremlins have 20 Armor
NOTES:
	Pistols are usually 1 hit kills
	Rifle is always a 1 hit kill
	Shotgun is a 1 to 3 hit kill depending on landed shots
	SMG is a 3 hit kill
	Numbers range from 4.5 to 26

// TRIAL 3:
CHANGES:
	Cybergremlins have 30 HP
NOTES:
	First fight is great.
	Unfortunately, projecting is a terrible suffix in most cases, and does not expire when the afflicted enemy dies.

// TRIAL 4:
CHANGES:
	None. How do Kobolds only have 20 HP in-game but take so much more damage before death?
NOTES:
	Ok, it's their stats. Dang... gotta figure this out now.

// TRIAL 5:
CHANGES:
	Changed gun points to 100,100,100,100
	Removed Consuming
	Temporarily Removing: Symbiotic, Lingam, Firewalling, Cup Filling, Projecting, Detrimental, Reinforcing
NOTES:
	-

// TRIAL 6:
CHANGES:
	Adjusted Hoopz armor to 20
	Removed levelup, changed StatRoll to 8 + 8
	Changed cybergremlin_small_deg to cybergremlin_small in the first area of the sewers.
NOTES:
	Hoopz receives large damage mitigation, down to 2.2, etc. from the Cybergremlins.
	Cybergremlins do not have any more HP. It seems to all come from stats.

// TRIAL 7:
CHANGES:
	Uncommented the Level Up script in Cybergremlins.
NOTES:
	There we go, the HP appears. LevelUp has:
		scr_stats_genEffectiveStats();
		scr_stats_resetCurrentStats();
	At the bottom. These need to be in the script of the entity, otherwise.
	
// TRIAL 8:
CHANGES:
	Hoopz default HP is 47
	Changed stats to rnd(5) + 5
	Adjusted Cybergremlin stats + HP
NOTES:
	Hoopz might might be slightly too low
	Lower Guts increase per unit HP
	Respawn rates of enemies FAR too high
	Might want to use that changeRoom variable I've proposed
	Too chaotic!!!
		REMOVE SOME SPAWN POINTS
	Dropped gun's are powerful. Remove some ammo.
		HOW DO I DO THIS???
	Make gun drops more common.

// TRIAL 9:
CHANGES:
	Added Piety = element resistance to Hoopz & others!
NOTES:
	Good work.

// TRIAL 10:
CHANGES:
	Changed ammo of generated weapons //scr_combat_weapons_prepareStats
	Changed Guts HP bonus from 10 to 5
NOTES:
	Too little ammo, and it applies to your starting gun's.
	The Guts feels decent. Harder for Hoopz, easier to kill enemies (and not such a huge variance in HP). Also lets armor have an effect.
	
// TRIAL 11:
CHANGES:
	Changed enemy life and armor across the board.
NOTES:
	Still need to remove spawn points - doing that now.

// TRIAL 12:
CHANGES:
	Took about a bunch of spawn points.
	Took out Aliens and the Sewer Beasts in the dirt corner.
	Changing starting gun values to 120,120,120,120
NOTES:
	MUCH BETTER!!! good amount of ammo too. Need to replenish on death though.

// TRIAL 13:
CHANGES:
	Added elemental resistances to enemies.
	Removed Exploding and Puddleific (too insane to look at).
	Will examine spawn points further.	
NOTES:
	Needs further reduction of spawns.
	Not sure at all yet how to do truly "alerted" spawns.

//-----------------------------------------
Hundley's Spawn Trials start here.
Notes:
	Increase sewer beast HP.
	Increase ammo? or make refill script.
	Change spawn facings to 0 for the shortcut.
	
// TRIAL 14:
CHANGES:
	Removed "Spawn Alerted" from all enemies.
	Changed some of the multiple spawns.
	Removed Sewer Beasts and Kobolds from Sewers 1-1
NOTES:
	Vision is weird!

// TRIAL 15:
CHANGES:
	Changing enemy facings towards Hoopz likely entrance, or a blend of directions per group.
	Increasing view cone from 120 degrees to 170... I think it could even go slightly higher than 180.
NOTES:
	Works pretty well! Will finish all areas, continue again.
	Having speed problems with the Shield Duergars.
	
// TRIAL 16:
CHANGES:
	Changed all enemy facings in Sewers 1-1.
NOTES:
	Still too crazy. Too many Cybergremlins, actually.
	
// TRIAL 17:
CHANGES:
	Removed some more Cybergremlins.
	Adjusted all the facings in Sewers 1-1 and all the Wasteland maps.
	Adjusted the vision cones to 200 degrees.
NOTES:
	DO MORE!
	
// TRIAL 18:
CHANGES:
	Adjusted all the facings in the Swamp maps.	
	Adjusted all facings everywhere.
NOTES:
	To Do: Replace Brutes Wall in Sewers Shortcut
	Replace Brute in Sewers 1-1.
	Replace Brutes in Sewers 2-1.
	Facings... MUCH better!
	
// TRIAL 20:
CHANGES:
	Tweaks to Sewers 1-1. Added constant enemies in a few spots.
	Increased range of all weapons.
	Added more knockback to heavy weapons.
