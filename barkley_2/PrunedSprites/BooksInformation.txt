document_page[4] = "In fact, the greatest of samurai were known to cut through multiple, fully-armored knights with a single blow. By contrast, the European longsword is dull and flat, quite often by virtue of their shoddy craftsmanship.

TRIMMED

Nah, not in the mood to read.
I-I don't think I'm allowed to read these books. I don't even know if I'm allowed to be here...

ORC TRIMMED DIALOG

Wow, books about orcs! I love orcs!
I'm turning my back on these books. Sometimes reading ISN'T fundamental.
As much as I love books, I love rules even more. Maybe I should talk to a librarian about getting a library card before reading anything.

REFERENCE TRIMMED

Reference books? I love references! Maybe they'll reference [Hyperborea XIV: Hyperborea DE.n_setsu].
Wow, I just don't get any of the references in these reference books. Maybe later.
I know reading is fundamental... but so are the rules. I'd better talk with a librarian about getting a library card before I even think about looking at one of these books.

AMAZING TRIMMED

Amazing books? I'm amazed already!
These books sure are amazing, but I just don't have the time to read 'em. Maybe later.
Books, huh? I've heard they have some pretty amazing secrets in 'em... but I'll never find out if I don't have a library card. Maybe I should talk to a librarian about that.

VIDCON TRIMMED

Books about vidcons? Awesome!!! I hope they've got strategy guides!
I... I don't ever want to leave... but I've got bigger fish to fry today than vidcons. I'll come back later.
It looks like these books are about vidcons... I LOVE vidcons, but I RESPECT rules. If I wanna check out these books, I should talk to a librarian about getting a library card.
