// Event script for what's essentially the CLIMAX of this quest. The player gets to the main security room but either doesn't have the hacking expertise, 
// or is too affected by the drugs Van Cleef gave him to do anything about it. 
// There's NO NARRATIVE WAY AROUND THIS, because even if he is some master hacker, he's too high to do anything about it.
// NOTE: This script is rather incomplete, since there's the need for light cinematics and sound here, none of which I can do right now.
// NOTE2: Created a quest called baseescapeQuest. It's technically a quest, but all it really does is change the dialogue of all the duergars 
// in the base to something that reflects the fact that the drugs the player was on is wearing off. It completes by leaving the base.
