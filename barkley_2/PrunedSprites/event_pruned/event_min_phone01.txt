// Script for USING THE TELEPHONE.
// NOTES FROM MY DESIGN DOC: So I thought of something that imo would be an interesting addition to this whole questline: A random courtesy phone sitting near Dozier in the duergar base. I'm always disappointed in videogames where you see a telephone or something of that nature sitting around and you NEVER are able to use it to randomly call people or do something in-character with it. Well, I thought it would be fun to remedy this. In addition to quest-specific things, I've begun writing the player calling random people they've met in the game world, although it's the player as a duergar, so the dialogue is kinda unintelligible, like getting a random call from your drunk asshole friend at 3 in the morning. For the hell of it I wrote brief phonecalls with Rene, Lafayette, and Slag. I don't know if anybody will care enough to contribute calls to this, but it's there if anybody wants to try it. I thought it'd be neat to be able to prank call Cuchulainn, but that might just be me.
/* I have endeavored to make Box#5 of the voicemail one of the strangest things in the game. SOMEBODY/SOMETHING is trapped in the voicemail system. You have to communicate with them through digits to get them to open the security room for you. Failure at any point in the dialogue tree prompts this entity to hang up on you or simply lose connection. It's not a REQUIREMENT to do this dialogue tree, since it's probably a fairly annoying dialogue tree and rather well-hidden, but it's the failsafe option to get into the security room if the player fucks up every other way to get into the security room or can't figure anything else out.

It's not adventure game stuff, so the player doesn't compile the words themselves, I came up with these words and presented them purely as numbers. I pulled this off the internet(yes, it's just purely digital leetspeak) to come up with the words you can throw at this person:
A4
B8
E3
G6
H#
Il
L1
O0
S5
T7
Z2
ABEGHILOSTZ

For the player's responses I used exclusively words I can make with the above letters. Which is VERY LIMITING but being able to spell Gae Bolg(643 8016) was a super-cool discovery and made me commit to actually doing it this way. PS No I didn't do all of this myself, I got help from SCRABBLE CHEAT SITES :D

I want to mention that I expect ABSOLUTELY NOBODY to figure this out, it's not a "puzzle" as much as it is internal logic in something really strange I've created, a bonus to anybody who tries to figure out what all these numbers mean. Just so you know. I more or less expect people to just fuck with this in order to figure it out. If anybody actually tries to crack this code, POWER TO THEM I guess.

// If somebody EVER gives out an award for MOST PEDANTIC HARD-TO-FIND TEXT EVER IN A VIDEOGAME, this script will single-handedly win the award. You're welcome.
// NOTE: RENE's states may be incorrect here. The Rene script has not been added to the game or updated. Currently Rene is known to the player and ALIVE between renefoodState=1 and renefoodState=4. He dies at 5, the player doesn't know him at 0. Rolling with that for now, though that may be inaccurate long-term.
// SOUND NOTE: Since it should be simple to create, and I don't mind adding the sounds in later, I'd really like this script to have some sounds. If only the sound of the player hanging up the phone, both a normal hangup and an ANGRY hangup. Obviously I'm thinking about one of those old school push button or rotary phones that you can ANGRILY HANG UP. I'm literally two decades behind everybody else, so I don't know if I had to SPECIFY THIS. Anyway, dialtones and button presses would be cool too, but that's not needed. I do have a voicemail tone written in, but I don't how much we REALLY care about this.
