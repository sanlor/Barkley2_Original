// Event script for the control room. This is Event#8, part2 in my Prison Break design document. This handles the player getting back their items and potentially leaving the location.
// CRITICAL NOTE: There's been some talk that the way this section of the game works should be changed, NOT giving the player back their items, and NOT allowing them the opportunity to escape at this point. I'm simply scripting what I have right now, just in case we go with it, and so the basic version of this quest can be played through. This entire script will probably be rewritten later.
// NOTE: No matter how I rewrite this script, this part NEEDS to be where the player is equipped with new weapons. There's been talk that all the prior equipments will be taken from the player permanently, which I'm cool with, but they need to be armed with SOMETHING for the remainder of this quest, and this is the place where this NEEDS to happen.
// PLACEMENT NOTICE: As of right now, this script should be for a stockpile of gun's sitting in the control room, maybe a CRATE. Regardless how this is revised, this may still be the way to do it.
// TIME TO CRATE COUNTER: I'm pretty sure this is my first crate. This is late enough in the game where if this is the first crate in the game, I think we've done reasonably well.
