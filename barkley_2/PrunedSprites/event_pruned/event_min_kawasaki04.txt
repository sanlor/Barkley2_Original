Time ain't a nice thing. Kinda thing that ain't gonna flinch if you look it in the eye.\Hell, I got a leg up on all the rest, and still time scares the hell outta me.\As great a thing as this was today, a day's gonna come along where I'm the only feller alive who remembers it.\I could sit around tellin' everybody about all I seen, but history don't work like that. It comes and goes.\When something big enough happens to create a shockwave, it's the kinda shockwave you ain't gonna see with your eyes or remember with your heart.\The kinda shockwave that rattles around in your bones.

Just the way things work. One day, way in the future, all this is gonna be wiped clean.\Maybe a couple things from the past will still be around, old enough where nobody much will make sense out of it. Words that ain't in the dictionary.\Prison's probably still gonna be here. Lasted this long, I'd wager what's left of my teeth somebody else is gonna get around to using it again.\It'll be a right funny grand opening. Going through the computer, finding this fading old rockpile with a life sentence still hanging around.\Happened before. I never put up much of a fight.");

Sure, first couple hundred thousand years it's as grand as can be.\Starts to weigh on you after a while. You get pretty nice things in your life, then as soon as you realize how good you got it, somebody come and takes it all away from you.\You get used to that, but it's right hard to go through this life without anything to call your own. Something waiting for you.\Probably sounds mighty silly to you, but that's what that prison is to me. It belongs to me. And I belong to it.\I left the whole ziggurat at points, sometimes for millions of years, but I always come back. Life and death's the same no matter where you go.\All the rest of these lives just flash by my eyes, all the new paint jobs that make their way on the prison walls. But that paint never sticks. Peels off after a while, and I get to see an old friend waiting there for me underneath.");

Our last escape attempt, they took out one of those laser gun's and vaporized him.\He was right behind me, we was almost there, and I heard those big clunky footsteps of his go quiet behind me. Turned around to see the last of him evaporating.\Couldn't find nobody good to chat with after that, these kids nowadays don't have much interest in talking to an old pile of rocks.\That's hard. You got your best friend, your only friend, and suddenly you got the rest of your life without him.\I guess you reminded me of him. It's in the eyes. Course yours are a lot fleshier, but you both had eyes that told me that there ain't a prison known to dwarf that could keep you locked up.\What, you didn't think I was going to lend my arm to any wiseass kid, did you?");
