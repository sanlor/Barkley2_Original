// BIO: An old duergar who can't fight anymore. Acts as a mentor to the younger duergars. I didn't really like how this dialogue works until it gets to the part where you can tease Oolon about the dwarfs you're not going to be bringing him. That part I kinda like, if only because I'm kinda pleased that I salvaged dialogue that I was going to just junk.
/* REQUIRED PART of "ngQuest", which is the quest where the player gets all kinds of keycards and certifications which do NOTHING but let the player access the hidden area of the duergar base. Maybe this does other stuff around the game world too BUT WHO KNOWS?!?!? IT IS A MYSTERY!!!!
Here is the quest breakdown
ngQuest=0 - The player has done NOTHING and is essentially worthless in the eyes of all quest participants.
ngQuest=1 - Player has spoken with Perry and given audience with Mr. Ng
ngQuest=2 - Player has spoken with Ng and has been [narratively] tasked with FILLING OUT IMPORTANT PAPERWORK
ngQuest=3 - Player has gotten the paperwork from Perry.(NOTE: Player can LOSE the paperwork and then ask for it from Perry again.)
ngQuest=4 - Player got the FORGED DOCUMENTS from Oolon
ngQuest=5 - Player spoke with Perry again and is again granted audience with Mr. Ng
ngQuest=6 - Quest complete
*/
// NOTE: There is not and probably will not be dialogue for the player coming back to Oolon if they threw away/lost the documents given in this dialogue.

All I have left are the memories.\But the memories alone aren't enough to keep me going. I go absolutely bonkers every time one of the youngsters brings back a leg or an arm, just something insignificant caught on their boot, a measly entrail.....\Then it all comes back. __________What I was, and what I never will be again.\Look, I gave you that sheet. It was really nice of me to do that, I could have traded it for more than just a couple dwarfs, I could get into a lot of trouble for sharing those sorts of documents.\But the thought of having dwarf blood, parts of their eyeballs, maybe even a tooth, on my hands again......anything is worth it......\Any price that I can pay will be paid.
