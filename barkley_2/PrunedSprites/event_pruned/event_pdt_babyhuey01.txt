// Hundley note: Minor revisions will need to be made to this if we change the name from Babby Hubert to something else. Just sayin', he talks about feathers and shit, and, presumably, he's talking about the ones attached to his person. I can do those revisions, though. Not a big deal.
// Hundley note2: Actually, revisions will also need to be made during the scene where Hubert gives the player his organs since I'm not sure how everyone wants to do that. I could design that myself, but I'm sure it'll come out incredibly gross and I kinda already promised that I would deliberately limit how many fantastically gross things I add to the game. So I'm passing the buck and letting someone else decide how that's done. PLUS, I feel like the player watching Hubert giving the player vital organs would be a great place for a very brief round mound choice, so I'll come back to it later to write one when I have some clue as to how I should be writing the round mound events.
// Hundley note3: yeah, more fucking notes. In this dialogue the player can either KILL HUEY OUTRIGHT by taking ALL of his organs, or just taking MOST of his organs. As I have currently designed this, it does NOTHING beyond display different dialogue for Hubert, since Oliver pays you the same either way and I didn't change that script to have Oliver pay you by the organs(which he didn't offer to do anyway). So you get "Duck Organs" either way, and the difference between the two is only SUGGESTED. Can change this if anybody has a problem with it, it just felt like more dialogue we didn't need.
// Hundley note4: After the player completes the quest, they can return to Hubert and give him his share of the money he got from Oliver. Hubert is, of course, dead, so the player can just very innocently leave the money by the corpse. This is all fine, I just left the money transaction incomplete because the quest reward has not been decided yet.
// Hundley note5: Made a call here in deciding that the player expressing skepticism at Hubert's belief system DOES NOT constitute an act of sentience on the player character's part and, therefore, not worthy of player input in the matter. Got a philosophical dilemma with this, whereby approaching the protagonist's skepticism as sentience, I would be essentially validating the overwhelming and destructive stupidity of Babby Hubert. I am not so disingenuous as to be able to do this.
