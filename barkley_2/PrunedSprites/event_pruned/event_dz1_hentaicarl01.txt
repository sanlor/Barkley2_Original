Spontaneous generation? We just come up out of the ground. I don't mean literally, we don't crawl out of the ground like cicadas. Some of us do. Some of us get born in egg sacs or in someone's womb. But it's because they spontaeously generated there, not because they were actually born. There's no reproduction involved, we just appear. And that's the way I like it. Me? I was born in a cabbage patch. If you don't like that, say it to my face. Hm? Good. I spend my time going from place to place, travellin' around, spreading my wings, you know? Sometimes I hang out here, sometimes I hang out there. All around. I just go all around. My life is like that. What I do with my life is my own business. North, south, east and west. Do you know the Horace Greeley quote, /'Go West, young man, go West.../' Believe it or not, that's not even the whole quote. There was more to that sentence, but I'm not gonna tell you. You'll just have to find out yourself, because I'm NOT telling you. Look, I know you want to know it, but I'm not going to say it. I'm not going to tell you what the rest of the quote was. Okay, okay, I'll tell you. Listen closely, I'll only say it once. Ready? Are you ready? Okay. Here I go... /'Go West, young man, go West and grow up with the country./' Got it? Did you catch that? I'll say it again if you didn't hear it, but this is the last time. My throat's parched though, maybe I should wet my whistle before I tell you again. Give me just a moment to rifle around my rucksack and find some water. Some aqua. Just a moment. Give me but a moment. Hold on, don't be impatient. Ah, I'm grasping a fine flask of water. It's grasped tightly in my hands. I'm bringing it to my lips. My lips are opening in anticipation, but also trepidation. Will the water be warm? Will the water be cool? Will it be safe? Whenever I put water in my special flask, I always warm it up over a fire first to disinfect it. Pasteurize it, you know? Here I go. About to drink. Gulp... gulp... gulp... ahhhhhh. Ahhhhh... that was a fresh gulp of water, just a hint of metallic flavor. Comes from the flask. It's an old flask. I was right, the water was warm, went down a little harsh. Didn't quench my thirst like I wanted it to. What did I tell you? What did I say? I said the water would be warm. You didn't believe me, did you? You didn't believe me when I said the water would be warm. But I had critical information you didn't have, and that's what you didn't expect. That water had been sitting in my rucksack all day. All the live long day. I knew it and you didn't. I saw it coming a mile away. You really walked into that one. But as I was saying, the Horace Greeley quote. Ahh. Here I go. Here's the full quote. /'Go West, young man, go West and grow up with the country./' Now what do you think of that? What do you think of that, hm? Now the reason I told you this quote is that quite frankly, I've been west. I've been west, north, south and east. I've been every direction in between. I've seen it all. I've seen the things that there are to see. Not all of them. I said 'I've seen it all,/' but I wasn't being literal. I've seen a good deal. I've been around. I've seen horses. I've seen juniper berries. I've seen trolleys. I've seen glass. I've seen 'dougs'. I've seen grottos. I've seen milk. I've seen curds. I've seen sorghum. I've seen turquoise. I've seen potassium. I've seen barbells. I've seen terrapins. I've seen meteors. I've seen sneakers. I've seen kelp. I've seen parrots. I've seen thick tomes. I've seen bellows. I've seen wise puppeteers. I've seen seesaws. Now I want to emphasize that I saw all of these things consecutively. I've seen rompers. I've seen squash. I've seen bluffs. I've seen clouds. I've seen undershirts. I've seen the hardware and the software. I've seen peppercorn. I've seen cornpone. I've seen gum. I've seen cubes. I've seen rickshaws. I've seen willows. I've seen every Shirley Temple movie. I've seen cobblestones. I've seen snouts. I've seen mosaics, both indoor and outdoor. I've seen fur. I've seen crepes. I've seen despair. I've seen birthday parties. I've seen morning dew. I've seen aspartame. I've seen holy stupas. I've seen dancehalls. I've seen sausage. I've seen neon signs. I've seen good objects. I've seen the moon. I've seen southern lights. I've seen glass. Ah, did I already say that? Let me start over. I've seen horses. I've seen juniper berries. I've seen trolleys. I've seen glass. I've seen 'dougs'. I've seen grottos. I've seen milk. I've seen curds. I've seen sorghum. I've seen turquoise. I've seen potassium. I've seen barbells. I've seen terrapins. I've seen meteors. I've seen sneakers. I've seen kelp. I've seen parrots. I've seen thick tomes. I've seen bellows. I've seen wise puppeteers. I've seen seesaws. I've already said this and I believe you caught me the first time, but in case you didn't, I'll repeat myself: I saw all of these things consecutively. I've seen rompers. I've seen squash. I've seen bluffs. I've seen clouds. I've seen undershirts. I've seen the hardware and the software. I've seen peppercorn. I've seen cornpone. I've seen gum. I've seen cubes. I've seen rickshaws. I've seen willows. I've seen every Shirley Temple movie. I've seen cobblestones. I've seen snouts. I've seen mosaics, both indoor and outdoor. I've seen fur. I've seen crepes. I've seen despair. I've seen birthday parties. I've seen morning dew. I've seen aspartame. I've seen holy stupas. I've seen dancehalls. I've seen sausage. I've seen neon signs. I've seen good objects. I've seen the moon. I've seen southern lights. I've seen hi-polymer erasers. That's not even the half of what I've seen. These peepers have seen it all. And now you know my story. Now you've got the Hentai Carl scoop. Don't believe me? You must believe me.");
