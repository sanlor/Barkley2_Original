// NPC script for Typhoid Larry, one of the duergars in the duergar encampment.
// From my design document: No prerequisites needed, the player gets into a gunfight with the three duergars through this dialogue. UPDATE: Essentially, at any point in time, the player can talk to Larry and pick a fight. This can be done BEFORE accepting the rebelQuest. You don't actually need to be involved in the rebel quest at all to finish this encounter. The dialogue with Lafayette plays out a little differently if this is the case, so I've compensated for that in the dialogue.
// note: tyhpoidlarryState=2 is fairly important, as it is the quest state that means that the player killed the duergars BEFORE Lafayette told them to do so. I have absolutely no idea how to do this myself.
// note2: The whole deal here is that this NPC and the two others with him go hostile and fight the player if the player gets antagonistic in the dialogue tree and stops kissing up to them. I have absolutely no idea how to do this, and have basically just left room for when someone can come along and give me a hand.
