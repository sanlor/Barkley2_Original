// [EVENT 2] Brief cinematic in the courtyard, the Warden giving a speech to the new prisoners.
/* From my design document: 
Fade in to the player being led into a large line of newly imprisoned dwarfs as they listen to a speech from the warden. A short speech ensues, 
and fades to black when it's completed.

As for location, this can simply take place in the courtyard unless there's another section that makes sense for this. 
The level design for the prison isn't necessarily set in stone, lots of directions we can still take it. 
We can probably decide where this should take place once we've designed the maps, but the courtyard is always an option.

NOTE: Critically important is the fact that the warden visibly uses an electrolarynx.

Bhroom NOTE: we can make this into a legitimate scene by having Lafferty start the wardenspeech variable to 1.  
The warden will be standing on a balcony in the Prison Map.
