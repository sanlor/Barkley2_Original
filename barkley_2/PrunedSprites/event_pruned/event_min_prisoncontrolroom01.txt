// Event script for the control room. This is Event#8 in my Prison Break design document.
// PLACEMENT NOTICE: This script should be placed at the entrance, so this script triggers when the player enters the control room. ALSO, since the player needs to equip themselves, this script also prevents the player from leaving the room until they've armed themselves in script "prisoncontrolroom02". So the player doesn't get TRAPPED, the security device the cinematic leads them to should be across the room, well out of the trigger circle of this event. You'll thank me in the end.
