// NPC script for Roethlisbuergar, one of the duergars in the duergar encampment.
// From my design document: The player needs to have purchased the rigged box of candy from Meinhardt. They leave it with them and it will explode. This doesn't necessarily need to be presented visually.
// Note: I don't know how to do this, but this NPC should GO HOSTILE along with the other two NPCs if the player triggers the fight in the Typhoid Larry dialogue.
// NOTE2: This script is hinged on there being the items "advent_calendar" and "rigged_advent_calendar". I have no idea if this is the appropriate naming convention for items, or even how to put items into the game, so this script will need an edit to reflect these when they're in the game.
// NOTE3: This script activates the "detectiveQuest" which is where Detective Coulombe hounds you for a while unless you finish enough rebel quests or successfully cover up the murders you just committed. Also activated is "detectivemineQuest" which is for the dialogue specific to the crime committed here. Not exactly the same thing.
