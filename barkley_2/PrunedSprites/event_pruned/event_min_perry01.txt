BIO: Mr. Ng's secretary. A bland, milquetoast kind of guy interested mainly in crunching numbers. 
Doesn't know that crunching numbers isn't an intrinsically violent action. 
ESSENTIAL PART OF THE BIG BOSS ROUTE.

UPDATE: I can't actually tell if Perry is just that unphased by the player constantly insulting/threatening him here, 
or if he is that oblivious to his surroundings. It must be OPEN_TO_INTERPRETATION.bat

REQUIRED PART of "ngQuest", which is the quest where the player gets all kinds of keycards and certifications 
which do NOTHING but let the player access the hidden area of the duergar base. 
Maybe this does other stuff around the game world too BUT WHO KNOWS?!?!? IT IS A MYSTERY!!!!

Here is the quest breakdown:
    ngQuest=0 - The player has done NOTHING and is essentially worthless in the eyes of all quest participants.
    ngQuest=1 - Player has spoken with Perry and given audience with Mr. Ng
    ngQuest=2 - Player has spoken with Ng and has been [narratively] tasked with FILLING OUT IMPORTANT PAPERWORK
    ngQuest=3 - Player has gotten the paperwork from Perry.(NOTE: Player can LOSE the paperwork and then ask for it from Perry again.)
    ngQuest=4 - Player got the FORGED DOCUMENTS from Oolon
    ngQuest=5 - Player spoke with Perry again and is again granted audience with Mr. Ng
    ngQuest=6 - Quest complete, just need to talk to Perry again to get the rewards.

I'm probably also going to edit this document later to compensate for Perry physically giving the player this paperwork.
Only remembered to do this after finishing the script.
Here is dialogue for if/when the player THROWS ALL THE DOCUMENTS AWAY and needs to ask for more from Perry.
I'll add it in later so the player can ask Perry for all the paperwork again.
No reason why he wouldn't have duplicates, Perry is a very dedicated secretary.

P_NAME: Hey, bucko. All that paperwork you gave me was eaten by Wildebeests.\Better give me all that garbage again.

Perry: Sure. Here you go.

P_NAME: Yeah, better keep more copies of this trash on the top of your desk. I'm probably going to lose these too.

PS, VERY IMPORTANT INFO: THIS ITEM ACTUALLY *DOES NOTHING* AS THE ITEM YOU NEED IS THE FILLED OUT VERSION YOU GET FROM OOLON.
MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE IT SO IF THE PLAYER FUSES A GUN WITH THIS TOTALLY WORTHLESS ITEM SOMETHING CRAZY/RIDICULOUS HAPPENS?!?!?!?
