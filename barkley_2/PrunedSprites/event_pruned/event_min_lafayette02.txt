// Event script for Lafayette, right as the player leaves the prison at the end of the prison phase of the rebel quest.
// PLACEMENT NOTE: Kinda stumped on this one, but Lafayette is supposed to basically END the quest for the player, as well as take Aloysius off their hands if they don't feel like continuing on with the quest at this point. The problem is where this is placed, I guess, as this is something that ABSOLUTELY MUST activate for the player when they leave the prison, but be close enough to the duergar base to make contextual sense. I think it would fuck things up if the player was allowed to continue walking around with Aloysius for a while
// CONTINUITY NOTE: It's probably relevant for the player to NOT be allowed to take Aloysius into the rest of the gameworld at this point, which they'd otherwise be able to do if this script is followed to the letter. There's room for a quest state to be added at the end of this script that prevents the player from leaving the area.
// REWARD NOTICE: I feel like there needs to be a quest reward for this. I haven't written it, and there isn't really a place for it, but I can find one if we come up with a suitable reward for this quest. I think getting fucking arrested to help this guy's cause is worthy of a reward of some description.
