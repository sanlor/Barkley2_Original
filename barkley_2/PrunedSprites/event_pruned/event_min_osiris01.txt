// BIO: I have no idea what this is, I just needed filler dialogue and I don't like people. This is literally what it sounds like to me when I'm forced to talk with people my age who are too invested in internet culture and it is a miracle I have not been imprisoned for violent actions. When old age wears away my restraining bolts I am certain I will indiscriminately murder people.
