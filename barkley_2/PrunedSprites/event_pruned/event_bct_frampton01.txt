/*
Frampton is the steward of the VRW Station Area.
He looks after the people that are stuck in VRW but still have the mortal needs in Brain City.
It would be great if he was applying Hydrating Gel into a VRW users mouth.
He feels like he's stuck in Diner Dash.  This could only really be pulled off if he has a cool dashing animation so the alternative is:
He jusy hates his job.

framptonState = 1 - you've met Frampton and he's told you to talk to Cosette to buy your account
