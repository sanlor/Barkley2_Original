// Bio: He is the BIG BOSS[of the duergar base]. He probably ran some sort of financial firm in another life, which would make him fully qualified to be a commanding officer in a dwarf genocide.
/* REQUIRED PART of "ngQuest", which is the quest where the player gets all kinds of keycards and certifications which do NOTHING but let the player access the hidden area of the duergar base. Maybe this does other stuff around the game world too BUT WHO KNOWS?!?!? IT IS A MYSTERY!!!!
Here is the quest breakdown
ngQuest=0 - The player has done NOTHING and is essentially worthless in the eyes of all quest participants.
ngQuest=1 - Player has spoken with Perry and given audience with Mr. Ng
ngQuest=2 - Player has spoken with Ng and has been [narratively] tasked with FILLING OUT IMPORTANT PAPERWORK
ngQuest=3 - Player has gotten the paperwork from Perry.(NOTE: Player can LOSE the paperwork and then ask for it from Perry again.)
ngQuest=4 - Player got the FORGED DOCUMENTS from Oolon
ngQuest=5 - Player spoke with Perry again and is again granted audience with Mr. Ng
ngQuest=6 - Quest complete

// GRAPHICAL NOTE: In my mind the sprite for this guy is this tiny body with this ENORMOUS HEAD with a very tight necktie that looks as though it is cutting off the circulation to his head. He is sitting behind a desk and probably does not need anything but the upper half of a torso. He probably doesn't need a portrait, though.
// NOTE: This script should probably be auto-trigger based on the player entering Ng's office, with a brief cinematic of the player walking up to Ng's desk, MAYBE even sitting down if we have seventy five minutes to do something totally wild and crazy. For testing purposes I'm just writing this as INTERACTION for now, I'll change that later.
