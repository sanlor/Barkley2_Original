// Event script for encountering Devigny after the control room sequences. This is Event 8, part 3 of my Prison Break design document.
// PLACEMENT NOTE: Devigny and this script should be progression blocking the player from reaching the maximum security wing(their next destination). They should be gone after the player leaves this map, since the two of them are off murdering at that point.
