// BAD ENDING NPC script for Van Cleef.
// NOTE: This is actually the totality of the game's bad ending, since absolutely everybody else involved in the quest ends up dead.
// PLACEMENT NOTE: I think it's really important for the player to be required to see this dialogue, so this should trigger at a pretty critical spot in the duergar base that CANNOT be missed.
