// Coulombe, encounter 4
// Detective who busts your ass for killing the three duergars around the campfire. Can be avoided by just avoiding the encounter with Coulombe, or by completing the other side of this quest, which is taking the detective job yourself and covering up the murders. This script is SUPPOSED TO auto-trigger when the player comes into range of Coulombe in his various locations. It's worth noting that Coulombe doesn't immediately bust you, he talks with you on four occasions, with the fourth encounter being the one where he will arrest the player.
// CONTINUITY NOTE: Coulombe will arrest the player in this script. This will either teleport the player to a currently-unwritten IN PRISON section, OR, if the player has completed the pre-requisites, to the jailbreak part of the rebel quest. Neither are scripted as of my writing this, so I will just note where this goes.
// NOTE: There is slight, currently unscripted movement in this. Ideally it would be Coulombe doing the movement, but seeing as how he probably doesn't need to the sort of range of motion required that the player already has, just writing this as THE PLAYER moves, rather than Coulombe. SOME of it is Coulombe, however, since we need to move him off the screen in order to make him disappear.
// TERMINOLOGY NOTE: Jumping the gun a bit, but I needed to assign one of our monsters as the monster that ate the duergars in the monster bait route. Laz suggested using a Yeti. I know nothing about this beyond the name, but I liked it enough to go with it. Someone let me know if it shouldn't be Yetis for whatever reason.
// ITEM NOTE: In the bait route, I have Coulombe give the player some Kobold Giblets. The EDIBLE KIND that his wife made, not the sort that you use to bait monsters. I'm guessing this is a consumable, but idk, this just felt like the right thing to do, where this guy gives you thanksgiving dinner leftovers after arresting you. Maybe this boosts one of the player's skills or something. I have no idea!!!
// HP NOTE: The player gets his HP restored at the end of the mine route. The wiki's instructions for doing this are unclear, stuff about string stats or whatever that make zero sense to me, so I'm skipping that until I can make sense of it.
// ANIMATION/SOUND NOTE: The player has the option of pulling their gun on Coulombe and attempting to shoot him in the gun route. Need to figure out the animation for this, the correct sound effects, and how the engine is going to treat this(will it just be the equipped weapon or first in gun bag????)
