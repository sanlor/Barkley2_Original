BIO: 
    Guard standing outside the duergar prison.
    He can arrest you for the prison quest if you haven't been arrested by Coulombe first. 
    Though you need to talk to Van Cleef before this arresting dialogue occurs.

NOTE:
    This dialogue is good as shit. I think the part with the mothballs is the best sentence I've written for this game.
NOTE2:
    Big deal here: This is one of the two scripts that link the player to the prison quest. They can't get arrested otherwise. 
    I don't know how to do that shit and it involves location scripts, so I've skipped that.
NOTE3:
    Late in this I decided to script a dialogue where, if the player escapes BEFORE completing the prison break quest(aborting the prison break quest essentially), 
    they can get back into jail by simply walking up to Socrates and talking to him again. This will not start the prison quest over from the start, 
    but essentially piggy-back on the generic cinematic that plays when the player leaves the courtyard every day, just getting taken back to their cell. 
    This may be irrelevant dialogue idk, but it's there if we need an ABORT in all of this.
