// Escape script for the NPC Kawasaki, one of the player's cellmates. This script appears when the player is ready to start their jailbreak.
// NOTE: Kawasaki assists the player as a combatant and follower in this general area. The combat comes later, but this NPC does follow the player after it's triggered in a script in this room. I've split the Kawasaki scripts into the one that just sits in the jail cell(kawasaki01) and another one for Kawasaki potentially running around helping the player(this script, kawasaki02). This may not have been needed, but I figure preparing for the possibility of that would be helpful. Merging this script into kawasaki01 wouldn't be a challenge anyway.
