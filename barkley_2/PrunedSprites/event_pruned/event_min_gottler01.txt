/* event_min_gottler01
NPC script for Gottler, a pissed off janitor who hates Hasdrubal. 
Speaking with him triggers the prank call section of the prank call quest, 
where you prank call Gottler in order to persuade him to confront and kill Hasdrubal.

/* 
Central character of the PRANK CALL QUEST(prankcallQuest) wherein you manipulate the Hasdrubal/Gottler rivalry in order to get Gottler to blow Hasdrubal away.
The prankcallQuest is pretty simple, though somewhat easy for the player to miss.
prankcallQuest=1 - Player is informed by Hasdrubal that he just took this job "to piss off Gottler"
prankcallQuest=2 - Gottler vents to the player about his hatred for Hasdrubal(Gottler added to the base phone directory)
prankcallQuest=3 - The player has prank called Gottler, prompting him to approach Hasdrubal.
prankcallQuest=4 - Gottler has killed Hasdrubal. Quest complete. Hasdrubal' corpse can be looted for a keycard.

// Some TEMPORARY SHIT here, primarily in that included currently in this script is the 
// cinematic dialogue for the encounter between Hasdrubal and Gottler. That may or may not be even in this script, 
// depends on if it'll be easier to handle it in another script entirely. 
// Even if it is, it'll need to be revised with cinematic data once the maps have been designed and all the graphics are in place.
