/*
NPC script for Compson, one of the characters in the makeshift rebel base. Provides no service and is of no consequence 
    outside my narrative intent.
From my design document - Bio: The leader of the rebel outpost. Completely defeated. In optional dialogue Lafayette 
    sends you to him to get further briefing, but Compson doesn't care and invariably blows you off. 
He's been busy figuring out a good place to dig his own grave.
This is a semi-dynamic script, where Compson gives the player mission "briefings" for each of Lafayette's missions.
    And by briefing, I mean that Compson basically tells the player to go to hell, often giving advice for how he 
    can get there. Felt that this was a useful contrast to the perky, upbeat Lafayette, where this other guy is 
    just telling the player how terrible these ideas are. The player isn't REQUIRED to talk to Compson, but Lafayette 
    talks Compson up as though it's a requirement.
So here's Compson's state breakdown:
compsonState=0 - never spoken to
compsonState=1 - spoken to once, no quests accepted(REQUIRED TO GET HERE BEFORE HIS OTHER DIALOGUE IS DISPLAYED)
compsonState=2 - spoken to regarding rebel quest #1(duergar camp)
compsonState=3 - spoken to regarding rebel quest #2(duergar base infiltration)
compsonState=4 - spoken to regarding rebel quest #3(prison break)
-ALL THE OTHER DIALOGUE USES THE REBELQUEST AS A TRIGGER-
*/
// NOTE: FLORIAN speaks during Compson's dialogue here. Presently he does not have a face. That may eventually change, but I'm scripting EVERYTHING with the assumption that I will not get any more portraits. This will need to be revised if Florian gets a portrait later.
