    Description
        Melqart is the duergar guard of the Lobby.
        He'll interject if you approach the upstairs or downstairs without a Visitor's Badge.
        He has a choice to start combat, and can also be turned on by Raffael shouting for security.
        
    Graphics & Animations:
        Duergar combat ability.
    
    Variables:
        melqartState
        melqartDead
            1 = Melqart has been killed.
    
    Operation:
        Melqart demands to see your badge when you approach a door without checking with him.
        Once you do, you are free to travel.
        Talking to Melqart at any point gives the option to fight him.
