/* Event script for the player's cell door. Some dialogue/events occur when this object is activated, so it's being treated like any other NPC.

This is EVENT#7 of my Prison Break design document.
// NOTE: Since it involves cinematics/teleportation(neither of which I can do right now), the scripted material in this deals exclusively with the events that occur 
         when the player has the key item ELECTROLARYNX and is actively breaking out of their cell. This script will also need to be revised later to include a teleporter 
         to the courtyard, which the player can do every day.
// ANIMATION NOTE: The prison door should open for the player at the end of this event. I don't even know if graphics are available for this yet, 
                   so it's not scripted here. Triggering this animation should also otherwise disable this script from being activated again.
*/ 

// FUTURE NOTE: Eventually this script needs to be updated to include the teleporter to the courtyard.
