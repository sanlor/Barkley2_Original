// BIO: The guy that guards the front gates to the interior of the duergar base.

/* NOTE: Most likely, I am going to pull Deveraux's dialogue from Van Cleef's document 
and put it here rather than have that work as one whole script. I kinda liked how that worked
initially as one long event, but something feels off about that, and I kinda like the idea of giving
alternate dialogue to the duergars hanging around the courtyard(rather than Van Cleef's script ultimately
bypass going through the Deveraux script and teleport the player to the interior section of the duergar
base directly). For demonstration purposes I'm leaving it in Van Cleef's section, but that's a change I will 
eventually make.
