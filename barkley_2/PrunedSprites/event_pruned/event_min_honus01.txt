Bio: The chief security officer in the duergar base.
Hasdrubal and Dozier kinda lead the player there, 
but the guy is dangerously unstable and doesn't help the player in any conventional way.

NOTE: This was supposed to be a much more complicated NPC, 
in that if the player FUCKED UP a bunch of times in the duergar base, 
Honus identifies you as a traitor, breaks your legs, and ejects you from the base. 
I elected against doing this since it kinda broke the quest logic 
AND because one of the side effects of this was the player actually getting 
permanently crippled and confined to a wheelchair the rest of the game 
(which had the perk of weapon weight having a drastically reduced effect on the player's movement speed). 
This was going to culminate in the player actually needing to crawl to the rebel outpost, 
where Lafayette would give the player his wheelchair. 

Really cool idea, but complicated stuff, and I didn't really feel like putting the hours in to make it happen. 
If somebody likes this idea enough, and doesn't mind allocating the resources to the wheelchair dynamic, 
I can go with this again, but I'll let somebody else decide this. Otherwise Honus is just another flavor NPC. 
For the record, I'm absolutely not against doing this, it just felt like an overly ambitious thing to try doing.

NOTE: After the fact I added the little dialogue where Honus reacts one time 
to the shit the player is doing over the base loudspeaker. 
I kinda center the honusState around this, so if anything more is done with him
 beyond what I've written at the moment, I'll need to come up with a unique state
 to compensate for Honus yelling at the player about the loudspeaker.
