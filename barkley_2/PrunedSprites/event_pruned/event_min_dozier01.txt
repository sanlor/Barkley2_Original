/* event_min_dozier01
Bio: Works at the help desk. Would rather be out killing things. Hates his life. 

UPDATE1: 
    A vaguely useful figure in this part of the quest, as Dozier GENERALLY directs the player around, 
    and is one of the trigger characters that the player needs to talk to in order to complete
    the quest (they can also talk with Hasdrubal). 
    
UPDATE2: 
    Really tried hard avoiding this too much with NPCs, but Dozier just repeats his dialogue if you ask him questions a second time. 
    Didn't feel like making a dozen quest states for this and write unneeded dialogue. 
    Decided it wasn't worth the effort, though I can change that if anybody thinks Dozier works a little awkwardly otherwise.

NOTE: This npc COULD be a work in progress if there are any other elements to this location that need to be added/explained. 
      It's all pretty modular though, with the dialogue tree and all, so it shouldn't be a hassle just adding in another choice in his little dialogue tree.
