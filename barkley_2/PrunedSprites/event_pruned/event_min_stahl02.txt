// Stahl NPC script - REBEL QUEST GOOD ENDING
// NOTE: This dialogue assumes that there is an inspirational poster of X114JAM9 placed around the gameworld. If this is the first place you've seen this, the idea is that a Che Guevara-esque poster appears at a couple fixed locations(probably one or two spots per main area) if the player gets the good ending of this quest. Though I'm not sure if I NEED to revise this if those posters don't actually exist anywhere, since it's not something the player would necessarily notice. Our hero is very modest, you know.....
