// NPC script for Compson, at the start of the Rebel Quest finale.
// PLACEMENT NOTE: Since I used it somewhat extensively in the duergar quest anyway, the courtyard is probably a good place to put Florian, Meinhardt, and Compson for the final infiltration quest.
// PS I love Compson btw. This may be my personal favorite dialogue in this entire fucking game. I hope people have been talking to Compson all along so they get to see his ARC OF MISERY.
