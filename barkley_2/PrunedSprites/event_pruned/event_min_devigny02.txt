// Escape script for the NPC Devigny, one of the player's cellmates. This script appears when the player is ready to start their jailbreak.
// NOTE: Devigny assists the player as a combatant in this general area, though not in this location, though this NPC does move around during this scene(controlled by other scripts). I've split the Devigny scripts into the one that just sits in the jail cell(devigny01) and another one for Devigny potentially running around helping the player(this script, devigny02). This may not have been needed, but I figure preparing for the possibility of that would be helpful. Merging this script into Devigny01 wouldn't be a challenge anyway.
