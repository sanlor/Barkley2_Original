It is also patron card of the beginning of journeys.##As card number zero, it represents the moment between positivity and negativity, the previous journey and the next. The fool is the moment of spiritual innocence between death and reincarnation, between life in the egg and hatching. It is the card of cusps and tipping points.##The egg is balanced, indicating a vernal or autumnal equinox. Day and night are equal to the fool. The fool lives in an infinitesimally brief moment of reality, in perfect stasis, with neither momentum nor inertia. Like the fool, you may just need a push forward... but don't let life just push you along. Freedom is good, but it would behoove you to set some concrete goals.";
text_card[1] = "The popess is the aspect of the wisdom gained from holy communion. She is represented by the number two, suggesting dialogue, and her two pillars evoke the idea of antennae with which to contact specters and higher deities.##The moon places the communication at night, and passing through the pillars brings one from waking night to the night of dreams. The fruits of wisdom from her excursions are shown in her scroll-swaddled hands.##Note that the figure obscures the second pillar... the Popess' divine wisdom is better grasped through faith than empirical knowledge. When you get lost out there, try using your same powers of intuition, youngster.";
text_card[2] = "Ah, the lovely Empress smiles! This is truly the most fecund of cards. Mother Earth offers forth her bounty. Figs, dates, and plums abound.##The Empress represents the will and ingenuity of civilization in harmony with the forces of nature. Water pours from the Empress' scepter into the fields of wheat, a symbol of prosperity and fertility.##Her casual pose indicates a grace and comfort with nature, but perhaps boredom or negligence. This card has many interpretations, but you can bet it will involve fruit.";
text_card[3] = "On this day, the Emperor rules. The layered crown is much like a 3D cross-section of his skull... golden adornments, red passions, and cool emotions.##The Emperor surveys, computes, calculates, and organizes. He considers himself a steward, custodian, and dad of his people, and always at the center of the Emperor's mind is his demense size.##Warning, youngster: I'm getting a read. This journey will take you through the jurisdictions of powerful authorities and principalities. Will you kowtow to them, or buck their rules? That time to make that decision grows ever closer.";
text_card[4] = "The hierophant has devoted his life to Clispaeth. The counterpart of the Popess, he subjects his body and soul to extreme trials, and renews himself with his unwavering piety. His disquieting presence is an indication of how far he has passed outside of this world and into a divine one. Imitating his spiritual ardor and legendary humility will be fruitful if you face similar ordeals. Affinity with Taurus grounds Hierophant, lends bull energy.";
text_card[5] = 'Lovers. Two beings in constant interaction, whose whole reality is dependent on that of the other. The apple shape builds and directs desire. The arrow indicates goals, directions, risks, and "letting things fly."##The arena you step into is shifting and dynamic. There is another side to everything. Causality will be hard to pin down, so claim the advantage by anticipating this.##Also, find true love on your journey.';

Even emblems of duty and will are built upon, wheels within wheels, constantly turning.##Earths and galaxies spin through space and time, and we witness the cycles of nature, life and death, death and rebirth… as represented by Chariot’s twin steeds, Dimensionality and Metempsychosis.## "Make each of your moments count." I think that’s all this card says.';
text_card[7] = 'Justice is swift, blind, and barbaric! This card represents truth and equilibrium. Life is weighed against death is weighed against the dignity of a dwarf is weighed against a mere bundle of grapes.##The swordsman holds the scale aloft, but the sword point touches the ground, indicating weariness. The curtain obscures the true method of decision-making even from the actor through whom justice is carried out.##Are you different, youngster. Do you know where you get your "right" and "wrong?" Please don´t say society...';

Want to hear something even more exciting?##The Hermit is the patron card of all loners, exiles, bad boys, rebels and outcasts of yesterday and today. All bosozoku, raggare, and greasers receive a passive initiative bonus, extending to the end of their next recovery phase. Virgins, monks, and hikkikomori earn the same and get a unique trophy.";

Tossing, throwing, and hurling.##These actions and more fall under dominion of Might.##And it seems Might has left indelible imprint on your past. The dim twinkle light in your eye tells of a mighty event not long ago, an eruption of might whose effects wracked the cosmos and stretch to the present. Such pure might… pursuit of this might is the game, [name], and the pieces are set. Ask yourself, "What mighty weapons will I tote?"';
text_card[11] = "A falling motion, inversion, hanging, waiting, “hanging out.” The environment is out of balance, in fact, the opposite of way things could be.##I wouldn’t worry about it though, youngster. It could be that the world is waiting for you to right it, but try seeing if you can get along well within it, even if it’s not something you’re used to. Wait, wait now... I'm hearing something about the letter M... and water elementals.";

Is it just a statistically-ensured probability, given the enormous size of the universe?##That’s all I can think about when this card arrives here. I apologize for the lack of insight, youngster. I don’t think the Death card would hurt you, though.";
text_card[13] = "Temperance, as a member of the Tarot, strikes a balance. While it's immediately a let down when you see it dealt, it makes up for this with a few perks.##Along with boredom comes volatility… perfect blandness cannot be achieved without its constituent elements constantly reacting in perfect synthesis.##The dwarf on the card slowly churns butter. A deliberate, measured churn returns the highest creamy yield, Remember this, my child. Hold on... I see butter reflected in your wan complexion. Interesting…";
text_card[14] = "Hush now, youngster. We must speak in hushed tones while the Devil lives on our table!##The dark lord’s sigil has aligned itself over the cosmic torus. Saturn’s ring ignites in white flame. Ambition, wickedness, and sulphurous vapours are the hallmark of this dismal time.##Those aligned to Capricorn—bearers of great sins—feel the loads of guilt they carry lightening.";

You must find this problem and stop it, purge it from the stream of existence, youngster.##You have no more time to waste here. I’m putting the cards away now.";

Millenia later later, modern Cyberpilgrims can be guided through advanced tech by any of trillions of stars.##Still, the star’s role remains the same—to watch over and silently judge us, cruel voyeurs of history. This uneasy give-and-take between man and star has persisted for eons. Is change coming? Is… is it you?";
text_card[17] = "The moon card is the most potent symbol of wisdom in the tarot, and also a symbol of madness. Much like how moonlight is originally the sun's, and not its own, so is the wisdom we find in the moon just a mirror of our own intuition.##In the river, we can see the reflection repeated, and of course, distorted. Mirroring of mirrors continually confuses and separates the vision of the original source.##Similarly, we must keep in mind that subjectivity can ruin the truth in reflection. If you're looking for answers, be a still surface, and let the moon look into you, not the other way around.";
text_card[18] = "Yes! What a great omen the sun card is! The look on the sun's satisfied visage suggests he can do no wrong. What a beneficent face!##The sun makes the flowers and plants grow. Thanks to the sun, it's warm enough to go to the beach. By harnessing renewable solar energy, anything made possible by fossil fuels could one day be run entirely on the sun's clean energy. There's nothing in this world that the sun doesn't have a hand in.##This is a really great draw, youngster. I mean it.";
text_card[19] = "Karma is the ethereal force of judgment and harmony that pervades existence. It represents justice on an eternal scale and with a focus that is individual and universal at once.##Maybe drawing this card doesn't mean much to you, but I believe what it is trying to tell you is that everything that occurs is known to occur. The world is not meaningless!##Everything that comes to pass today will come to pass again. What you do on your journey will be remembered, child.";
text_card[20] = "The universe card is the final card in the tarot deck. It represents finality and totality. The end, and everything at the end.##Your journey has not yet begun, and yet I can tell you are destined for many great adventures. Who knows where they will take you? Wherever you go, I would hesitate to think of an 'end,' youngster.##You have so far to go and infinite potential. Wherever your journey concludes, I don't think it will be the 'end' for you.";

text_card[23] = "Ah, the card of the juggler. It seems that nearly every culture has its own juggling legends, and this archetypical figure is usually depicted as a crafty rogue who dazzles god and man alike with a fusion of dynamic sporting moves and entertainment sensibility.##His accompanying form is the dark juggler, a malevolent acrobat who tosses its bowling-pins and kerchiefs with ill-intent.##Notice the juggler's workshop spans a river. The river's mists imply Maya, the fog of illusion that hangs over the sporting world. Both jugglers and dark jugglers alike profess that they are looking for the truth. It will be up to you to decide who you believe.";
text_card[24] = "Shown here is the mountebank, a fiend in the guise of a knave. The mountebank is talented at knowing, and tirelessly schemes to gain advantages through control of the forces of knowledge and ignorance. Notice that his worktable spans a river, suggesting Lethe. It forms a bridge between the world of memory and amnesia.##With his deck, the mountebank can divine truths with the tarot, or deceive others in his treasured game, Monte. See the candle with which he can selectively illumine truths, and the three magic mirrors that grant him perspective. He is also armed with a cup of intoxicating tinctures.##The mountebank is a cheater, of course. His red scarf of guilt clings to his neck like an albatross. It would be wise to advance prudently in your pursuit of knowledge, youngster.";
text_card[25] = "Shown here is the magician, a figure of arcane power. The magician, through study and sacrifice, has conquered the divide between the world of thoughts and that of physical existence. His alchemical rites use the power of word and ideal to twist and shape the universe.##Notice that his worktable spans a river. The magician's sorcery creates a bridge between the phenomenal and noumenal worlds.##With his magic wand, the magician levitates three azure zaubers. All are glowing with the divine spark. The clear absence of jugglers in this picture precludes juggling as an explanation. An admittedly shallow read suggests zaubermancy in your future... could it be?";
